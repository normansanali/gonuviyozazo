That’s why we said leave of absence.”</p><p>Heinerscheid was reportedly axed because “the wholesalers would have had an absolute HAY DAY with leadership if they didn’t remove her,” another source said.</p><p>The insider added that Blake “was actually awesome,” and suggested that his sacking wasn’t warranted.</p><p>“I think he was just caught in the crossfire.
