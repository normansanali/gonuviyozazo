second time.&nbsp;He was eventually named Naismith Player of the Year 2011.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career-statistics-and-injuries></span><strong><span>Career statistics and

Rivers, his father, achieved the first father-son coach-son tandem in the NBA.</span></p><p><span>After quite a bumpy ride for him with the Clippers, the 6-foot-4 man made a move to the Washington Wizards in a trade that saw Marcin Gortat move to LA.&nbsp;Bradley Beal as the third guard.&nbsp;The move was successful although Doc Rivers would have liked to stay with his son.</span></p><p><span>Although he has had his own injury issues including the one that saw him play up to 18 games, he has had a pretty good career so far.&nbsp;Rivers averaged 130 rebounds per game, 2.4 assists, 0.7 steals, 0.2 blocks and 9.4 points per game.&nbsp;He had a career-high 15.1 points, 4.0 assists, 2.4 rebounds and 1.2 steals per game in his final season with the
