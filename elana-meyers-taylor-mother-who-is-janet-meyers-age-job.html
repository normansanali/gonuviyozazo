She was also a cheerleader at one point. Although she couldn’t get the chance to go to college, her dream to become a star athlete is living through her Olympian daughter.</p><p>Like Janet, Elana also played several sports. But, her passion was always Olympics, and Janet was prepared to make it happen. In college, she played Softball but coaches discouraged her saying that she joined in too late for that. But, the Meyers were watching the Torino Winter Games, Janet suggested she try bobsled if she wanted to make it into Olympics.</p><p>Janet started coaching her way before she got into college and watching her daughter want to be in Olympics more than anything she said, “You know what? If you want to make this happen, we can make this happen.”</p><p>On Mother’s Day 2016, Elana wished her mom via a Facebook post. She captioned, “Happy Mother’s Day to the best Mom in the biz- the woman who made me who I am! I love you Mom! And Happy Mother’s Day to all the other moms in the world!”.</p><h3><strong>Janet Meyers Husband And Kids</strong></h3><p>The Meyers household always encouraged to pursue sports because Elana’s parents were also athletes back in their days. Elana’s father Eddie played football in college at the U.S. Naval Academy. Later, he played in the NFL for the Atlanta Falcons.</p><p>Eddie Meyers has been serving at PNC Bank Georgia as the bank’s President. He was promoted to the position in December 2011, before that he worked in the role of Executive Vice President & National Investment Manager for a little above six years from October 2005 to December 2011.</p><p>He had joined the job at the bank in March 2000 as Business Development Officer.</p><p>Back in 2015, Eddie spoke with The Baltimore Sun about his job at PNC and shared, “My goal was to get into banking and this job gives me thrills. I’m blessed to do something I look forward to each day and I get paid well. How much better could it get?”</p><p>During the marriage of Eddie and Janet which lasted over 33 years, they also had other two daughters — Erica Warren (<a href=#>@mrsericawarren</a>) and Elise A Brown (IG: <a href=#>@ebrown_rn</a> & FB: <a href=#>@Brown26.Elise</a>).</p><p>Erica is relatively private about her life. Meanwhile, Elise currently works as Employee Health RN at Wellstar Health System. She formerly worked as a Nursing Supervisor at Wellstar Health System. Elise is married to Tremayne Brown and currently lives in Austell, Georgia.</p><h3><strong>What Is Janet Meyers Ethnicity?</strong></h3><p>By ethnicity, Janet Meyers is White American, whereas her husband is African-American. This is why Elana identifies herself as a bi-racial athlete.</p><h3><strong>Janet Meyers Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in 1959, Janet Meyers is 62 years old.</p><h3><strong>Janet Meyers Job</strong></h3><p>In different interviews, Elana had mentioned that her mother was a student-athlete but her real job remains unknown. She was probably a housewife taking care of her three children. As for her husband, he wanted to be in NFL more than anything. Janet’s husband waited six years to play in an NFL regular-season game, which never happened.</p><p>From 1982 to 1987, Eddie served six straight years in the military and used his marine leave to join the Atlanta Falcons training camp. He played exhibition games &nbsp;— 23 carries, 108 yards, one touchdown in total, according to the&nbsp;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&nbsp;— but never in the regular season, because duty called.
