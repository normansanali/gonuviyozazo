Lots of collectors go on the journey to find that one elusive, ultra-rare card. When it comes to the hobby of basketball card collecting there are few names that come with more reverence than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who is hailed as an absolute&nbsp;legend among Los Angeles Lakers' cards. Below, we break down the catch of the 5 most expensive basketball card sales that included Hall-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and each made bank for at least five figures or more.</p><h2>The Iconic 1969-70 Topps Rookie Card</h2><p>In 2020, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's famous 1969-70 Topps rookie card showing Alcindor holding the ball behind his head went for an astonishing $216K in a private sale. On an individual level, this card is a testament to Abdul-Jabbar's longevity in the NBA as it represents not only Karl Malone of his era but also Kobe Bryant: any Lakers star that didn't wear No. 32 can simply never be considered one of them. This undoubtedly explains the price tag of more than a million dollars for this card in flawless PSA 10 condition, making it one of basketball cards' ultimate treasures.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Coveted Second-Year Card</h2><p>Immediately tasked with the gargantuan shadow of his rookie card, Abdul-Jabbar's sophomore effort is one that still tantalizes buyers and collectors to this day. This card, featuring Kareem at the top of his skyhook against a vibrant blue background is considered one of the most iconic cards ever and can go north $40k in pristine PSA 10 condition. What makes this card so magnetic is not just that it symbolizes the transition of Abdul-Jabbar to Los Angeles, a place he would go on to win five legendary championships.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Timeless 1971 Topps Lew Alcindor</h2><p>The player known as Lew Alcindor before he adopted the name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, his 1971 Topps card remains one of the decade's most iconic cards. Its enduring charm and cultural part in American history brought the card an amazing $66,610 with a PSA 10 evaluation. This design speaks strongly to the heart of the '70s and its time capsule status guarantees that it will never fall out of favor among basketball card hobbyists who collect these Garbage Pail Kids-like relics.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>1975 Topps Kareem Abdul Jabbar $ Priceless</h2><p>This simplistic, yet attractive look to the first card in Abdul-Jabbar's Lakers journey was looped around pieces of gum being added into wax-lined shopping bags. It is a well-desired card (and not going to lie, I wish it was in my collection) because this $33.6k PSA 10 pristine copy sends shockwaves through the community as one of the most prized possessions by collectors everywhere. A classic design paired with the player's appeal allows a card to join even better value in every basketball card collection.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>1986 Fleer Kareem Abdul Jabbar</h2><p>The 1986 Fleer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar card is an iconic and genuinely beautiful one in the world of basketball card collecting. In a sale, this card went for $9,300 while graded in PSA 10: proof of its enduring charm and historical nature. This card is one of the cornerstones of some of the most important basketball cards ever produced and therefore it represents a lifetime symbol for what Abdul-Jabbar contributed in his time spent playing professional NBA Basketball.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>But How Do You Find the Jewels Buried?</h2><p>Uncovering these gems - in the exciting realm of basketball card collecting - requires research and is an incredibly astute observer. Online channels including auction houses, connoisseur card marketplaces, and sports memorabilia websites are indispensable in new sale discoveries and hoop card trends. Additionally, interacting with other collectors and making use of social media sites tailored to sports memorabilia can offer beneficial indications regarding major basketball card sales.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>To sum everything up, the world of basketball card collecting is an enticing realm that showcases incredible legends like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
