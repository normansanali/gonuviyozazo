His brother Eli Manning is a famous quarterback and his other brother Cooper Manning was a talented receiver in high school until a stenosis of the spine prevents it.&nbsp;dreams.</span></li><li><span>The fact that he wears the number 18 on his jersey is not random, he wears it to honor his brother Cooper, who wore it when he was still playing football.</span></li><li><span>He is considered one of the smartest players in the NFL.&nbsp;Manning completed a 4-year program in 3 years and on his return in 4th year to obtain a master’s degree.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Manning often calls audibles while playing football and he actually received the nickname “The Sheriff” from color commentator Jon Gruden due to his tendency to be audible before the shot.</span></li><li><span>On March 7, 2016, Manning said these words in his retirement speech, “I’ve fought a good fight. I’ve finished my football run and after 18 years it’s time. God bless you all and may God bless football.”</span></li><li><span>Peyton is the recipient of numerous awards, including 5 NFL MVPs, 2 NFL Offensive Player of the Year, 3 NFL Most Valuable Player ESPY Awards, 14 Pro Bowls among a host of other awards.&nbsp;His trophy room should look like something out of&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Hoarders</span></strong></li></ul><p><span>Now, before we get carried away with the athlete and all his other accomplishments, let’s start with the topic of Peyton Manning’s height.</span></p><p><span>See also: Blake Shelton height, weight and body measurements</span></p><h2><span>Height of Peyton Manning</span></h2><p><span>When it comes to talent, awards, and his peak, this athlete packs his bags.&nbsp;He is so tall that if he wanted to change football for basketball, this is a profession that would suit him perfectly.&nbsp;So how tall is Peyton Manning?&nbsp;The 5-time MVP award winning football player stands proudly at 6ft 5in.</span></p><p><span>His stated height is actually spot on and we can Because unlike the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who always has a team of scientists dedicated to determining his true height, people believe Manning is 6 years old.&nbsp;Now you can see why we were having such a debate about its size.</span></p><p><span>Just in case you are still unsure how tall 6ft 5in is, here are the names of some other well-known personalities who stand as tall as the athlete.&nbsp;Usain Bolt, Vince Vaughn, Joe Manganiello and Zlatan Ibrahimović all share the votes of Peyton Manning.</span></p><p><span>That’s all we have on the football player’s spectacular height.&nbsp;Now let’s move on to Peyton Manning’s weight.</span></p><p><span>See Also: Kevin Durant Height, Weight, Body Stats and Net Worth</span></p><h2><span>Peyton Manning weight</span></h2><p><span>It is no news to anyone that athletes must maintain peak physical condition, it is an inevitable condition that comes with their work.&nbsp;All we can say for Peyton is that he was by far one of the most dedicated and hardworking athletes in the NFL in his day and it showed in his physical condition.</span></p><p><span>How did the athlete reach his ‘optimal physical state’?&nbsp;To answer this question, we decided to give a brief summary of his in-season and off-season fitness routine.&nbsp;He usually started with exercises for his core (Russian turns, tossing the balls over the head and balls sitting on top of the ball), then he would do flexibility exercises followed by agility exercises, after which it ended with bodybuilding exercises.</span></p><p><span>It was a typical season for the athlete while he was still active, now it seems that like most professional players he forgoes intense training sessions.&nbsp;What’s even more alarming is that he looks like he hasn’t been to a gym in a long time.</span></p><p><span>No, he’s not overweight, quite the opposite, according to&nbsp;</span><strong><span>12UP</span></strong><span>, Manning has been a bulky man throughout his career, but judging by his looks, he’s shed quite a few pounds pretty quickly.</span></p><p><span>See also: Dwayne Johnson height, weight and body measurements</span></p><h2><span>Peyton Manning Body Net Worth</span></h2><p><span>Along with Peyton Manning’s height and weight, here’s a rundown of all her body measurements specially curated for all the house skimmers.</span></p><p><span>Height: 6 feet 5 inches</span></p><p><span>Weight: 104 kilograms (230 pounds)</span></p><p><span>Size at chest: 46 inches (117 cm)</span></p><p><span>Height: 35 inches (89 cm)</span></p><p><span>Biceps: 15 inches or (38 cm)</span></p><p><span>Shoe Size/Feet: US Size 13.
