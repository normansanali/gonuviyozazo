With homes ranging from the East to the West Coast and everywhere in between, Swift can change her locale at the drop of a hat and have a change of scenery that fits her mood.</p><p>While some of the properties that Swift owns are away from the hustle and bustle of the city, others are located directly in the heart of New York City. As such, when Swift decides to stay in more metropolitan areas, the paparazzi keep track of her every move. But, spending time in the city also allows Swift to see if there are any new properties that catch her eye. It happened in 2015 when Swift was made aware of the fact that a townhouse next to hers was for sale.</p><p>Wanting to make a huge penthouse out of her existing townhome and the one next door, Swift purchased the property.

Peter Jackson was away at the time and given that McKellen did not own any property in New York City, calling London home instead, Jackson offered his townhome to McKellen while he was in town.</p><p>McKellen accepted the offer and settled into Jackson's townhome.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar48778289-1.jpg><p>In June 2015, McKellen was in New York City to be co-Grand Marshall of the New York Pride parade. The parade took place just two days after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was a right of all Americans.

She did ask me to appear with Patrick Stewart at her show in LA, but I had something else to do that night."</p><p>Stewart and McKellen even went on to try to join Swift's Squad as a result of the situation, tweeting out, "So @IanMcKellen recited Bad Blood and I did Blank Space on @NPRAskMeAnother.

You've made my day. You two are ULTIMATE Squad Goals." Even Taylor Swift recognizes that<a href=#> Stewart and McKellen are friendship goals</a>.</p><p>While McKellen did get kicked out of the plush pad he was staying in, compliments of Jackson, he had no hard feelings towards Swift when she bought the townhome. After all, it was a temporary fix and McKellen got to enjoy his time in New York City, leaving as a Swiftie before it was all said and done.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lm56wrLHDZqqiql2erq95zJyinqScmrtuu9StZKieXZa9or7TppynrF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./viewsonic-v3d231-3d-display-the-passive-approach.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ViewSonic V3D231 3D Display - The Passive Approach</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./recipe-index-root.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Sesame &amp;amp; Almond Asparagus Salad</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
