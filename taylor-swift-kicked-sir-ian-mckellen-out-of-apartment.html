With homes ranging from the East to the West Coast and everywhere in between, Swift can change her locale at the drop of a hat and have a change of scenery that fits her mood.</p><p>While some of the properties that Swift owns are away from the hustle and bustle of the city, others are located directly in the heart of New York City. As such, when Swift decides to stay in more metropolitan areas, the paparazzi keep track of her every move. But, spending time in the city also allows Swift to see if there are any new properties that catch her eye. It happened in 2015 when Swift was made aware of the fact that a townhouse next to hers was for sale.</p><p>Wanting to make a huge penthouse out of her existing townhome and the one next door, Swift purchased the property. However, in doing so, Swift got Sir Ian McKellen kicked out of his apartment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sir-ian-mckellen-was-staying-in-peter-jackson-39-s-apartment>Sir Ian McKellen Was Staying In Peter Jackson's Apartment</h2><h3 id=mckellen-39-s-rental-home-was-up-for-sale-while-he-lived-there>McKellen's rental home was up for sale while he lived there</h3><p>In 2015, McKellen was staying in Peter Jackson's apartment in New York City. Peter Jackson was away at the time and given that McKellen did not own any property in New York City, calling London home instead, Jackson offered his townhome to McKellen while he was in town.</p><p>McKellen accepted the offer and settled into Jackson's townhome.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar48778289-1.jpg><p>In June 2015, McKellen was in New York City to be co-Grand Marshall of the New York Pride parade. The parade took place just two days after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriage was a right of all Americans. As such, there was a lot to celebrate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McKellen was in town to promote his film</a>, Mr. Holmes. He was also in attendance for other professional functions and to accept awards as well. As such, it made sense for McKellen to use Jackson's townhome if it was going to be vacant given that his time in New York was going to be lengthy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Has Had This Glow-Up Since She Started Performing Live</a></span></p><p>However, while McKellen was staying in the townhome, Jackson had let him know that it was on the market. Given the finicky nature of the New York City real estate market, it was not certain how quickly the townhome would sell.</p><p>When Jackson's neighbor caught wind that his abode was for sale, she jumped on the opportunity.

This meant that Swift's square footage of her townhome was about to dramatically increase. As soon as the walls were dropped, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor's townhome became a penthouse</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-11.jpg><p>The TriBeCa real estate was converted to become a penthouse with "10 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, a billiards room, and an incredible sweeping staircase." This allowed Swift to have her peace and quiet while in the city given the space of her home.</p><p>This proved to not be quite large enough for the Lavender Haze singer, as, in 2018, Swift also purchased yet another townhouse in the building — <a href=#>property is another way Swift spends her massive fortune</a>.</p><p>The new townhome was located directly below Swift. There have not been any details to date about whether this will be a standalone property or one that will also be worked into the existing floor plan of the penthouse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The SNL Moment That Changed Taylor Swift's Career</a></span></p><p>Given that she is currently on tour and not staying in New York, Swift has offered the penthouse in TriBeCa to her friend, Sophie Turner while she navigates her divorce from Joe Jonas.</p><p>Unlike McKellen, there is no fear of Turner being evicted from the home before she is ready to go.

She did ask me to appear with Patrick Stewart at her show in LA, but I had something else to do that night."</p><p>Stewart and McKellen even went on to try to join Swift's Squad as a result of the situation, tweeting out, "So @IanMcKellen recited Bad Blood and I did Blank Space on @NPRAskMeAnother. May we join the squad, @taylorswift13?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift replied to the two saying, "Thanks for reciting my lyrics, @IanMcKellen and @SirPatStew! You've made my day. You two are ULTIMATE Squad Goals." Even Taylor Swift recognizes that<a href=#> Stewart and McKellen are friendship goals</a>.</p><p>While McKellen did get kicked out of the plush pad he was staying in, compliments of Jackson, he had no hard feelings towards Swift when she bought the townhome. After all, it was a temporary fix and McKellen got to enjoy his time in New York City, leaving as a Swiftie before it was all said and done.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lm56wrLHDZqqiql2erq95zJyinqScmrtuu9StZKieXZa9or7TppynrF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./viewsonic-v3d231-3d-display-the-passive-approach.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ViewSonic V3D231 3D Display - The Passive Approach</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./recipe-index-root.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sesame &amp;amp; Almond Asparagus Salad</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
