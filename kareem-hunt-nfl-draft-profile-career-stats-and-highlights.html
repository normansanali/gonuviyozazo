As a freshman, he appeared in twelve games, starting 3 and rushing for eight hundred and sixty-six yards on one hundred and thirty-seven carries with six touchdowns.</p><p>During his sophomore season, he missed 3 games as a result of an injury, appearing in just ten games, despite missing out in some games, he&nbsp;still&nbsp;rushed&nbsp;for&nbsp;a minimum of 101 yards&nbsp;in each of the games he played. At the end of that&nbsp;season, he&nbsp;recorded two hundred and five carries with sixteen touchdowns for 1,631 yards. He was named the MVP at the&nbsp;2015 GoDaddy Bowl after he rushed for&nbsp;271 yards and 5 touchdowns in the game against the&nbsp;Arkansas State which ended in a win.</p><p>Kareem was banned from playing the first two games during his junior season for violating team rules.

His college&nbsp;rush records broke the school’s rush record&nbsp;set by Chester Taylor Hunt&nbsp;became the third&nbsp;in MAC conference history to mark such record.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Kareem Hunt NFL Draft Profile, Career Stats And Highlights">Kareem Hunt NFL Draft Profile, Career Stats And Highlights</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Other Interesting Facts">Other Interesting Facts</a></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=kareem-hunt-nfl-draft-profile-career-stats-and-highlights></span><strong>Kareem Hunt NFL Draft Profile, Career Stats And Highlights</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kansas City Chiefs selected Hunt 86th overall in the 3rd round of the 2017&nbsp;NFL Draft. He was the 6th running back to be selected in that draft and the first of the three players selected from his college team that year. He was named the starting running back during the team’s 3rd&nbsp;preseason game against the&nbsp;Seattle Seahawks after&nbsp;Spencer Ware suffered a knee injury.</p><p>His first NFL appearance was in September in a game against&nbsp;the&nbsp;New England&nbsp;Patriots. Despite never fumbling during his college career, Kareem messed&nbsp;up&nbsp;his first&nbsp;professional&nbsp;career&nbsp;carry so that Patriot’s Devin McCourty had&nbsp;to go recover the ball. That notwithstanding, Hunt still finished that game with a total of two hundred and forty-six yards from scrimmage, the highest ever in an NFL debut.</p><p>In December, he was listed among the squad for the 2018 Pro Bowl&nbsp;as a rookie. He found his endzone for the third time in a row in week sixteen games against&nbsp;the Miami Dolphins where he rushed ninety-one yards and one touchdown. The following week, he emerged third in rushing yards behind&nbsp;Le’Veon Bell and&nbsp;Todd Gurley.</p><p>He is currently still playing for the City Chief. Below is a table of what his NFL career stats look like so far.</p><table class="vk_tbl Uekwlc"><tbody><tr><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd">Year</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd">Team</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Rushing attempts">ATT</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Rushing yards">YDS</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Average yards per carry">AVG</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Rushing touchdowns">TD</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Total receptions">REC</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Receiving yards">YDS</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Receiving yards per reception">AVG</th><th class="Z3XQ4e Gt0LNd r4NXy" title="Receiving touchdowns">TD</th></tr><tr><td colspan=10></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">2018</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">Chiefs</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">52</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">168</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">3.2</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">2</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">1</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">5</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">5.0</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">1</td></tr><tr><td colspan=10></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">2017</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">Chiefs</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">272</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">1,327</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">4.9</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">8</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">53</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">455</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">8.6</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">3</td></tr><tr><td colspan=10></td></tr><tr><td class="Z3XQ4e zdF0Cc">Career</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy"></td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">324</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">1,495</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">4.6</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">10</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">54</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">460</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">8.5</td><td class="Z3XQ4e r4NXy">4</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-interesting-facts></span><strong>Other Interesting Facts</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kareem Hunt’s mother Stephanie was an athlete, she used to run tracks while in school but the mother of two currently works as an&nbsp;independent&nbsp;healthcare provider&nbsp;in Lorain, Ohio.</p><p>The NFL running back currently stands at a height of 5 ft 9 in (1.8 m) and weighs 201 pounds (91&nbsp;kg).
