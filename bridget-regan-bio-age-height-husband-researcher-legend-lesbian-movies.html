She is famous for such portraits as Kahlan Amnell in the TV series Legend of the Seeker, Rebecca Lowe / Rachel Turner in White Collar, Rose Solano in Jane the Virgin and Dottie Underwood in Agent Carter.&nbsp;She has also portrayed Sasha Cooper in TNT’s drama series The Last Ship since 2016.</span></strong><span id=more-21494></span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN AGE</span></h2><p><span>Born on February 3, 1982, Bridget turns 36 in 2018.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN HEIGHT |&nbsp;BRIDGET REGAN MEASUREMENTS</span></h2><p><span>She is 1.75 meters tall.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN HUSBAND</span></h2><p><span>She has been married to Eamon O’Sullivan since 2010. Bridget met Eamon, who is a writer in New Zealand while filming Legend of the Seeker.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN FRANKIE JEAN</span></h2><p><span>His firstborn, a daughter, Frankie Jean, was born in December 2010.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN RESEARCHER LEGEND</span></h2><p><span>Regan has since 2006 appeared in various TV shows and in movies.&nbsp;She started filming Legend of the Seeker, a TV show based on Terry Goodkind’s Sword of Truth series, in 2008. She played the role of Mother Confessor Kahlan Amnell, which earned her a cult following.&nbsp;Regan dyed her hair dark brown and black, and sometimes chemically straightened it, for Legend of the Seeker, though her natural hair was red and curly.&nbsp;She ventured into production with Camp Wanatachi, a musical that took place in New York at the La MaMa Experimental Theater Club, in 2009. In 2012, Regan was cast as the lead in the proposed television series The Frontier.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN WHITE COLLAR</span></h2><p><span>Regan began a recurring role on the fifth season of the USA Network crime drama White Collar in 2013, as Rebecca Lowe/Rachel Turner, a brief love interest of Neal Caffrey.</span></p><h2><span>THE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</span></h2><p><span>She also joined the Beauty & the Beast series for a multi-episode arc as Alex, the ex-fiancée of Vincent Keller (Jay Ryan), the same year.&nbsp;As the existence of Regan’s character created a love triangle that included Vincent and Catherine Chandler, it resulted in rabid hatred for Alex and nasty Twitter posts for Regan, from fans who would rather Vincent be with Catherine.&nbsp;She said: “I can’t watch Twitter anymore!&nbsp;…I get why people don’t like Alex, I guess, but I can’t really watch anymore.&nbsp;‘ Regan was in 2014, cast in a recurring role on Jane the Virgin, as Rose, a former lawyer, later criminal mastermind, who becomes embroiled in a complicated same-sex affair.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN JOHN WICK</span></h2><p><span>In 2014, she had a small role in John Wick, as Addy.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN WONDER WOMAN</span></h2><p><span>From 2009 to 2013, Regan, who is popular with the comic book community, was commonly selected among comic book fans and critics as their go-to choice to portray Wonder Woman.&nbsp;MTV’s Rick Marshall said, “In one of the highest-voted, yet uneven, weekly polls we’ve ever conducted here on Splash Page, Legend of the Seeker actress Bridget Regan was voted fans’ favorite lady to bring DC’s iconic Amazon warrior, Wonder Woman, on the big screen.&nbsp;‘ She garnered over 62% of the total vote, well ahead of well-known and lesser-known actresses.&nbsp;In 2013, Andrew Dyce of Screen Rant commented, “Casting Wonder Woman may seem like a tall order, but if you ask online fan communities,</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN THE LAST SHIP |&nbsp;BRIDGET REGAN’S LAST SHIP</span></h2><p><span>Regan was in 2016 added to the cast of TNT’s drama series The Last Ship for the show’s third season, where she played the role of Sasha Cooper, a current diplomat in Asia and a former Navy intelligence officer.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN GREY’S ANATOMY</span></h2><p><span>She was cast in Grey’s Anatomy as Megan Hunt in 2017.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGANAGENT CARTER</span></h2><p><span>In 2014, Regan had the recurring role of Dottie for 2015 in the comic-based TV series Agent Carter.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN PREGNANT</span></h2><p><span>Regan on November 17, 2017, announced that she and her husband were expecting a second child.&nbsp;on February 28, 2018, their son, Bernard Moon, was born.</span></p><h2><span>BRIDGET REGAN ON INSTAGRAM</span></h2><a href=#

Virgin.</span></p><h2><span>MACGYVER SEASON 3 SPOILERS: THE LAST SHIP ALUM BRIDGET REGAN</span></h2><p><strong><span>Source: cartematt.com</span></strong></p><p><span>MacGyverMacGyver has been killing it lately with a lot of his guest stars, and you can go ahead and add Bridget Regan to the list now.</span></p><p><span>Responding to a fan on Twitter, Regan confirmed she was appearing in an upcoming episode of the CBS show, but didn’t reveal any information about her role.&nbsp;We think it would be fun to see her play a bit more of a villainous role here, especially after being a character like Sasha on The Last Ship who fought so continuously for good throughout the series.</span></p><p><span>Even with the end of the TNT show, Regan has certainly remained very busy.&nbsp;She may still have a few more appearances to come on Jane the Virgin, and many of her other credits include White Collar (where she played an adversarial role with Matt Bomer Neal Caffrey) to accompany Agent Carter and a cameo appearance on Grey’s Anatomy as Owen’s sister, Megan.&nbsp;(Due to scheduling issues, the role was later recast with Abigail Spencer taking over.)</span></p><p><span>MacGyver is currently nearing the halfway point of Season 3, and the mission remains much the same: tell great stories starring these characters, who possess the rather unique ability to find and provide safety no matter what. circumstances.&nbsp;are all around them.&nbsp;There will eventually be some sort of major shift later this season with the apparent departure of Jack Dalton from George Eads, but that’s something we’ll be moving on more as we get closer to his release.&nbsp;There may not be much to say at the moment.</span></p><p><span>Going back more to some of the other big guest stars who have appeared on MacGyver recently, just think David Dastmalchian, Holland Roden, Lance Gross, Tate Donovan or Reign Edwards.&nbsp;This is a series that has done a pretty great job over time of building and expanding its universe, mostly so that there are interesting people around the main cast members.&nbsp;With that in mind, we’re hoping Regan can return to the line for more episodes…although much of that will depend on what role she takes on.</span></p><p class=postsid
