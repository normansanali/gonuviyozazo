Though his career might have just kickstarted, the San Francisco 49ers Quarterback is making a name for himself—even if he was dubbed “Mr. Irrelevant” at the beginning.</p><p>“Nothing jumps out about him physically, but&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>he’s a good, sound, fundamental</a>, composed, consistent player. And that goes way farther than the height and weight and speed. He’s a football player,” corner Bradley Roby told NBC Sport. “He has things you can’t measure. You can’t measure heart, you can’t measure composure, you can’t measure pocket escape ability, you can’t measure anticipation, you can’t measure being a leader. All that stuff you can’t measure. That’s why he wasn’t drafted until the seventh round. Sometimes you just gotta see what somebody’s like on the field. He does a great job in his position. He does all the things he needs to do.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DVFxtargetreview.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/askawitch_question4_FI.jpg><p>Born on December 27, 1999, in Queen Creek, Arizona, Purdy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has a highly athletic family</a>.

The best-selling book delves into the history of the first Super Bowl, which was originally known as the AFL-NFL Championship Game. (The term “Super Bowl” was coined only in its third year.) The debut game, between the winning Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs, was played in front of only 61,946 people at&nbsp;the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum—an audience well&nbsp;below the stadium’s capacity. Harvey Frommer, a sports historian and reporter, puts the tale of that momentous game together using oral history, gathered by hundreds of interviews with players, coaches, media and spectators alike.</p><p>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.
