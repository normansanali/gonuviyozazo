Taylor, 51, was an original cast member on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a>&nbsp;with the likes of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a>. When the long-running Bravo series premiered in 2010, Taylor was married to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Russell Armstrong</a>&nbsp;</strong>and they were living luxuriously with their daughter <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kennedy Caroline Armstrong</strong></a>, who is now 16. However, Taylor’s co-stars, as well as the viewers, eventually learned that Taylor was secretly being abused by Russell. Their marriage ended in <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a devastating tragedy</a>&nbsp;and the aftermath was explored on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Taylor-Armstrong-Relationships-NBC-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Taylor left RHOBH&nbsp;after the third season and got remarried years later to <strong>John Bluher</strong>.&nbsp;She’s stayed away from reality television since then, aside from this <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>new season of&nbsp;RHUGT</a> that premieres June 23.&nbsp;Here’s everything you need to know about Taylor’s two marriages and the heartbreak that occurred in the first.</p><h2>What Happened To Taylor Armstrong’s First Husband?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Taylor met Russell, a venture capitalist, while she was waitressing at a restaurant in Beverly Hills in 2005. They got married less than a year later and then Taylor gave birth to their daughter Kennedy in 2006. When&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;started in 2010, fans instantly saw&nbsp;conflict between Taylor and Russell play out but she always put on a brave face and hid the truth from the cameras. There were rumors that Russell was experiencing financial issues and was abusing his wife, but Taylor didn’t confirm it in the first season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Taylor-Armstrong-Relationships-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>In season 2, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Camille Grammer</strong></a>&nbsp;exposed on-camera that Taylor was being abused by Russell. It was revealed that he hit her so hard he caused an orbital fracture that required reconstructive surgery. Taylor suffered a breakdown during the season, which years later spawned into the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>famous cat meme</a>. In July 2011, after filming for season two concluded, Taylor filed for divorce and accused Russell of verbal and physical abuse.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>On August 15, 2011, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Russell was found dead</a> after he committed suicide by hanging. Russell’s first wife&nbsp;<strong>Barbara Armstrong</strong>, with whom he shared two sons, blamed Taylor for the tragedy. “I don’t care for her at all. I think she’s the reason for this,” Barbara told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Radar Online</a>.&nbsp;Russell’s suicide happened before the second season of&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;premiered, so production partially edited him out. They also had the&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;cast, sans Taylor, react to Russell’s passing in a scene that kicked off the season.</p><h2>Taylor Armstrong’s Second Husband</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Taylor-Armstrong-Relationships-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Taylor stayed on&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;for one more season in the aftermath of Russell’s <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>death</a>. Following the show, Taylor met lawyer John Bluher who was helping her deal with financial and legal issues. John was separated but still legally married to&nbsp;<strong>Stephanie Bluher</strong>, the mother of his three children, when he fell in love with Taylor. After John finalized his divorce, he proposed to the reality star in August 2013 in Mexico. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>They got married</a> in April 2014 in a beachside ceremony in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles. Taylor was escorted down the aisle by her then-8-year-old daughter Kennedy in front of over 100 guests, including some of her former&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;co-stars.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Taylor and John are still together today. He’s adopted Kennedy as his daughter and the family of three resides in Orange County, Calif. Taylor’s been open about how grateful she is to have found love after experiencing an abusive first marriage. “That’s why I believe I’m married now because I would’ve never trusted anyone again,” she recently told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>. “After all the lies that were built in my previous relationship, having someone that just stood by me, it was the reason that I trust him so much, and we became best friends.” We’ll see if Taylor discusses either marriage on season two of&nbsp;<i>Real&nbsp;Housewives:&nbsp;Ultimate Girls Trip.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OasKWnomKus7nSramoppditba%2FwZqlnWVkbIRzg5drZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leonardo-dicaprio-avoids-plane-crash-after-engine-shuts-down-20102211.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leonardo DiCaprio Avoids Plane Crash After Engine Shuts Down</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kendall-minter-obituary-atlanta-and-kendall-minter-atlanta-law.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>kendall minter obituary Atlanta and kendall minter Atlanta law</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
