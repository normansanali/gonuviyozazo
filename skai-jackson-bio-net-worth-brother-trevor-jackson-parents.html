you’re talking about.&nbsp;She is an American actress and the Zuri Ross show in Disney Channels,&nbsp;</span><span>Jessie</span><span>.&nbsp;Her passion for acting started from the age of four and she considers that she would act what she would do all her life.</span></p><p><span>Her contact with the media world dated back to when she was still a baby, appearing as a child model in several television commercials.&nbsp;She got her break in 2007 when she appeared in the independent film&nbsp;</span><span>Liberty Kid</span><span>&nbsp;but her role as Zuri Ross in the TV series&nbsp;</span><span>Jessie</span><span>&nbsp;brought her to fame.</span></p><p><span>She has appeared in many other films which include&nbsp;</span><span>Rescue Me, The Rebound,&nbsp;</span><span>Arthur&nbsp;</span><span>Ultime Spider-Man</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Smurfs</span><span>&nbsp;and in different TV series such as&nbsp;</span><span>Pains royales,&nbsp;</span><span>Sesame Street,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Boardwalk Empire</span><span>.&nbsp;Skai was the voice character of Isa the Iguana from the cartoon&nbsp;</span><span>Dora the Explorer</span><span>&nbsp;and Little Fish on Nick Jr’s&nbsp;</span><span>Bubble Guppies</span></p><p><span>This cutie has also appeared with some of the biggest names in Hollywood.&nbsp;In 2013, she appeared with Dwayne Johnson, Channing Tatum and Adrianne Palicki as Roadblock’s daughter in an action thriller/movie.&nbsp;</span><span>GI Joe: Retaliation.&nbsp;</span><span>She currently stars in the Disney series&nbsp;</span><span>Bunk’d</span><span>&nbsp;alongside Peyton List, Karan Brar, Miranda May and Nina Lu.</span></p><p><span>She has a good head on her shoulders at such a young age and she plans to become a film director and producer in the future.&nbsp;Skai was nominated for the Image Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Youth (Series, Specials, TV Movies or Miniseries).</span></p><p><strong><span>See Also: List of Peyton Bio, Age, Feet and Legs, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family</span></strong></p><p><span>She was bullied to be short and admonishes that every bullied child needs to talk to an adult and learn how to defend themselves.&nbsp;Her height is 4′ 11″ which will increase in the future considering she is still very young.</span></p><p><span>She may be small but never gives in to bullies or her enemies and would always come out stronger than they expected of her, leaving them singing her praises and trailing behind her.&nbsp;She stands up for a good cause and has the courage to point out the wrong facts.&nbsp;Skai thinks she had a career before Disney and will after.&nbsp;She told Azealia Banks that tongue whipped her after she made a racist and homophobic comment on Twitter.&nbsp;Such a strong girl.&nbsp;Banks really had the charm of his life.</span></p><p><span>Skai Jackson is in love with

approval, but had to choose one.&nbsp;And baby Skai never looked back from there.</span></p><p><span>Kiya who manages her daughter part-time said she is cool with her career and has never been shy about bringing her into the industry.&nbsp;She thought she at least made enough money to go to college.&nbsp;Skai was in New York, but her mother had to move to Los Angeles after she auditioned for and got the part on a Disney show.&nbsp;</span><span>Jessie</span><span>&nbsp;when she was 9 years old.</span></p><p><span>Kiya posts her daughter’s impressions and videos from her childhood on her
