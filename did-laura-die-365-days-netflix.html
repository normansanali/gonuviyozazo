The movie, which was adapted from a book of the same name, tells the story of a young, beautiful woman who is kidnapped by a mafia boss. The mafia boss, Massimo, is so desperate to get Laura to fall in love with him that he gives her 365 days to fall for him. Since its release, 365 Days has faced some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">backlash</a> for this problematic premise.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The ending of '365 Days,' explained:</h2><p>Laura begins the movie resistant to Massimo's proposal, but as time passes, she finds herself falling for the mafia boss. By the time their year together is over, Laura has committed herself to staying with Massimo, and the two wind up preparing for their wedding. In the movie's final scene, we get an ambiguous ending that has left many fans of the film wondering whether Laura survived.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the film's closing moments</a>, Laura and her friend Olga are returning from a wedding shopping trip. As they return, Mario, one of Massimo's men, begins to suspect that a rival gang is targeting Laura. Although Mario rushes to tell Massimo about his suspicions, by the time he finds him, it's too late. The movie ends with a police van parked outside a tunnel, suggesting that Laura may have been killed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Laura die at the end of '365 Days'?</h2><p>Things are left up in the air in the film's concluding moments, and we never get a definitive answer to the question of whether Laura is dead. In that final moment, Massimo remembers the first time he saw Laura on a beach, which may suggest that he also believes her to be dead. There are several compelling reasons to believe she may still be alive, though.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There may be a '365 Days' sequel in the works.</h2><p>One of the biggest reasons to believe that Laura is still alive is that this movie is based on a trilogy of books. If the movie is a success, Netflix may be interested in producing sequels, and since the first movie is so focused on Laura and Massimo's relationship, the sequels would likely be as well. If she died at the end of the first movie, it would mean re-calibrating the entire series.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>It's possible, then, that Laura's friend Olga was killed and Laura was instead kidnapped by Massimo's nemesis. That way, the next film in the series can deal with the fallout as Massimo attempts to get Laura back.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who could have taken or killed Laura?</h2><p>No details are offered as to who specifically took Laura, but Mario does describe the gang as Massimo's nemesis. Using context clues from earlier scenes in the film, we can guess that the gang may have been those involved in the death of his father earlier in the movie.&nbsp;</p><p>There's even a section of the film where Massimo sends Laura off while he takes care of unfinished business. When he returns, he has a wound on his chest, which may have come from his plan to get revenge on the crew that killed his father, and led to the creation of a new enemy.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecuarKuZXZm2pnmSb2xmnJGuwG66xK2dpaGo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-bimby-aquino-yap.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Bimby Aquino-Yap</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eboni-nichols-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eboni Nichols Net Worth How Much is Eboni Nichols Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
