And while it may be a physical reminder that you are getting older (and undoubtedly wiser), these days, it's all about natural beauty and embracing another year around the sun, and all the change that comes with it, including gray hair. But when those rogue gray hairs multiply, leaving you with a full-on gray or salt-and-pepper head of hair, we'd like to know how to handle the process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, what causes gray hair, why do some of us start going gray earlier than others, and how should you care for gray hair? With the help of Shari Marchbein, MD, we're answering the most common questions about going gray, along with how to care for naturally gray hair.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Shari Marchbein</a>, MD, is a New York City board-certified dermatologist.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-does-hair-go-gray></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Does Hair Go Gray?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Hair color is determined by your genetics and the pigment called melanin, of which there are two main types: pheomelanin (red) and eumelanin (black or brown)," says Dr. Marchbein. "Gray hair occurs when the pigment cells (or melanocytes) in the hair start producing less melanin." How much melanin your body produces is also determined by genetics, too.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-causes-hair-to-gray></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Causes Hair to Gray?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The most common cause of gray or white hair is normal aging. As people get older, their hair eventually turns gray and then white. Dr. Marchbein says that this process is called achromotrichia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Achromotrichia normally begins in the early to mid-20s in men and late 20s for women," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, hair color and race are two factors that can affect when you'll start to go gray. According to a study by the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>British Association of Dermatologists</a>, fifty percent of the population has about 50 percent gray hair by the age of 50. The results of this research also found that the rate people go gray is linked to their ethnicity. Caucasians and redheads tend to gray earliest.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The age at which graying begins seems almost entirely due to genetics and therefore can’t be changed, although thyroid abnormalities, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stress</a> events (which may make you shed hair and the resulting hair that grows back may be a different color), as well as certain vitamin deficiencies can lead to gray hair," says Dr. Marchbein.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-you-prevent-gray-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can You Prevent Gray Hair?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The answer? No. Although there are external factors like stress events that can trigger shedding and gray hair, when and how you go gray is entirely up to genetics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, don't waste your money on all of those supplements and topical products out there that claim to delay the inevitable. Dr. Marchbein says they're not going to work. "Our predisposition to graying is determined by our genetics, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>age</a>, and subsequent melanin production in the hair," she explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-is-gray-hair-different-than-your-original-color></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Is Gray Hair Different Than Your Original Color?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First off, gray hair doesn't turn gray — it grows that way. Dr. Marchbein says that the melanin production in hair is reduced from its original blonde, brown, or red shade. So, as we age, the new hairs that grow are more likely to be white or gray.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On top of its gray or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>silver</a> color, these hairs can also be a different texture. "Gray hairs tend to be coarser and drier than your natural hair color," she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-steps-should-be-in-your-gray-hair-color-routine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Steps Should Be In Your Gray Hair Color Routine?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First things first: Don't pluck them. When you start to find a few random grays, grabbing your tweezers might seem like a good idea, but plucking out a gray hair isn't going to get rid of it because it will grow back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another reason not to pluck? It can damage the hair follicle. "Dermatologists recommend not plucking hair of any kind, not because it will produce more of that hair, but because repeated trauma to the hair can damage it, and actually make you permanently lose hair from that spot," explains Dr. Marchbein.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to getting gray hair, our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>scalps also tend to become drier</a> as we get older, too. Dr. Marchbein recommends cutting back on how often you wash your hair every week so that you don't strip it of its natural oils, and cutting back on hot tools so hair doesn't get brittle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gray hair is also prone to brassiness from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>styling</a>, pollution, and environmental damage, so washing it with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>purple shampoo</a> (the same formula for blonde hair) once a week will help cut out the yellowness so white and silver hair looks vibrant and shiny again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wK%2Bcq5mXmnqis8RmnqudqWK1orXRZmxsbGVohnU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-nfl-player-christian-mccaffreys-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is NFL player Christian McCaffreys net worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-paul-reuben-movies-and-where-to-stream-them.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The best Paul Reubens movies and where to stream them</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
