While he was not found guilty in the original 1992 murder trial, in 1997, the former athlete was found liable for their deaths in a civil case and ordered to pay the families' restitution. Following the recent death of OJ (he died from prostate cancer on April 10, 2024), the spotlight has been shone on his life and his relationship with Nicole (one of the most high-profile couplings before their split).</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/oj-simpson-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="OJ Simpson's Bank Card Goes On Auction Despite Claims He Only Used Cash">OJ Simpson's Bank Card Goes On Auction Despite Claims He Only Used Cash</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>OJ Simpson's expired credit card is on sale.

"Johnnie Cochran just created that. It was part of the performance," Dominique said. "He knew that it was good timing, after Rodney King, to introduce [race] into the court."</p><p>Dominique also recalled that despite her sister being murdered, she and her family were subjected to awful threats. "We got all kinds of death threats," she told the outlet, noting how Simpson's race had never been a topic of discussion within the family prior to the trial. "Race was never an issue in our family," she said. Their other sister, Tanya, commented on the family's heritage, saying, "We come from a very diverse [extended] family, we have Mexican, Black, German, Jewish, family and friends."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Brown family was also unfamiliar with OJ Simpson prior to his relationship with their sister, Nicole. "We didn't even know about him or football," Dominique told People. "He was just her boyfriend to us." But when they did see him play, they were impressed. But it was not just good times between Nicole and OJ, and their relationship was volatile. "All hell broke loose when we came home that night," Denise told People of how OJ's behavior changed following his game because he had reportedly seen Nicole kiss a mutual male friend on the cheek. "He had her upstairs in the bathroom crying. He said, 'You embarrassed me.'"</p><h2 id=what-do-nicole-brown-simpson-39-s-sisters-think-of-her-murder-trial>What Do Nicole Brown Simpson's Sisters Think Of Her Murder Trial?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/oj-simpson-and-nicole-brown-simpson-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even to some of Nicole Brown Simpson's closest friends and family, it was hard to tell that she was unhappy in her relationship.
