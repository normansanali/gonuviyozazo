On April 28, 2012, at the age of 19, he made his MLB debut with the Nationals.</p><p>Being the youngest position player to participate in an All-Star Game, Harper was chosen for the 2012 All-Star Game.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Harper shared the NL lead in home runs in 2015 and won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award in 2012.</p><p>He was selected as the National League Most Valuable Player for 2015 by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, and at the age of 22, he became the youngest MLB player to receive the honor.</p><p>He signed a 13-year, $330 million deal with the Phillies as a free agency during the 2018–19 offseason, which at the time was the most expensive deal ever in North American sports before being surpassed shortly after by Mike Trout.</p><p>With the Phillies, he earned the NL MVP award for the second time in 2021.
