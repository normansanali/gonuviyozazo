"Ever since I was in high school I’ve always wanted to… study in the United States," she said. "I looked into different schools that were good academically and also at hockey, and Duke was one that really jumped out at me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After completing her master's degree, the field hockey star moved to New York where she worked at the Wall Street accounting firm, Deloitte. In 2016, she moved back to the UK to work for the company's London office. Seaborn's return actually inspired Sheeran to take a break from music. "We were basically like, 'Let's both quit our jobs and let's have a year of forming a tight bond and relationship," the latter told Beats 1/Apple Music's Zane Low.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar48909757.jpg><p>"So we went traveling and spent every day for a year together," Sheeran continued, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">later telling People</a> that after ending his tour, he realized that he "hadn't ever really lived a life" or "properly formed relationships with people so I needed to have a year off and spend it with friends and family and Cherry and actually become a human being."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seaborn still reportedly works as a consultant but hasn't turned her back on field hockey. In 2021, Sheeran was spotted watching his wife play with her team in Suffolk.</p><p>Not much is known about Seaborn's personal life, but it's a known fact that she's Sheeran's ultimate muse. In fact, the singer's hit, Perfect was written after they attended a party together at James Blunt's house. "We got really hammered and took our shoes off and danced on his lawn and then jumped in the pool," he later told Radio.com. "And then the next day I was like, 'That's a cool story,' so I put it in a song."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Secret Behind Ed Sheeran’s 50-Pound Weight Loss</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-ed-sheeran-meet-his-wife-cherry-seaborn>How Did Ed Sheeran Meet His Wife Cherry Seaborn?</h2><p>Sheeran and Seaborn have known each other since they were kids. They first met at Thomas Mills High in Suffolk, England, and became friends for a while. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview on Armchair Expert</a> with Dax Shepard, the <a href=#>smartphone-less musician</a> said that if he and Seaborn had dated back then, "it would have been a disaster." After losing touch when he went on tour and she was moving to the US, the two later reconnected in New York City; thanks to a mutual friend who invited them both out.</p><p>"One day, she was in New York and she went to go out with Cherry because Cherry worked on Wall Street," Sheeran said on the podcast of his friend, Lauren. "And then she was like, 'Oh Cherry Seaborn is in town, do you want to hang out?' I was like, 'Yes.'" He admitted to being nervous back then as they'd "hooked up" the last time they saw each other. "So in my head, I was like what if she remembers that because it was like a while ago. It was very innocent. Very gentle, it was a kiss," he shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar46612986.jpg><p>In 2018, they tied the knot in an intimate ceremony. With only 40 guests, Sheeran described it on Table Manners with Jessie Ware podcast as a "tiny, tiny event," noting that they "did it at night on a random day in the middle of January in the middle of nowhere. No one knew, no one came to it. We lit candles, we got married, we went back [and] had a curry."</p><p>In August 2020, they welcomed their first daughter, Lyca Antarctica, 2. "We are completely in love with her," he wrote on Instagram at that time. Two years later, the Photograph performer announced that they'd just welcomed baby no. 2, another girl. "Want to let you all know we've had another beautiful baby girl," he wrote on the platform. "We are both so in love with her, and over the moon to be a family of 4 x."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Taylor Swift And Ed Sheeran's Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=inside-ed-sheeran-39-s-wife-cherry-seaborn-39-s-tumor-diagnosis-during-2nd-pregnancy>Inside Ed Sheeran's Wife Cherry Seaborn's Tumor Diagnosis During 2nd Pregnancy</h2><p>Recently, upon announcing his new album Subtract, Sheeran opened up about the difficult time that led him to his "deepest, darkest thoughts" and his "honest" new music. "I had been working on Subtract for a decade, trying to sculpt the perfect acoustic album, writing and recording hundreds of songs with a clear vision of what I thought it should be," he said in a press release. "Then at the start of 2022, a series of events changed my life, my mental health, and ultimately the way I viewed music and art."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar50730439-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued: "Writing songs is my therapy. It helps me make sense of my feelings. I wrote without thought of what the songs would be, I just wrote whatever tumbled out. And in just over a week, I replaced a decade's worth of work with my deepest darkest thoughts." He then revealed that his wife was diagnosed with a tumor during her second pregnancy and that his best friend had died after a month.</p><p>"Within the space of a month, my pregnant wife got told she had a tumour, with no route to treatment until after the birth," he said in the statement. "My best friend Jamal, a brother to me, died suddenly and I found myself standing in court defending my integrity and career as a songwriter. I was spiralling through fear, depression and anxiety."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>Don't artist</a> confessed to feeling like he "was drowning, head below the surface, looking up but not being able to break through for air." Set for release on May 5th, Subtract is "opening the trapdoor into [Sheeran's] soul." He explained: "For the first time I'm not trying to craft an album people will like, I'm merely putting something out that's honest and true to where I am in my adult life. This is last February's diary entry and my way of making sense of it. This is Subtract."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuscNmqqGdlaeur7%2BMsKCfnV2Ytaa%2B0bJkrJ2Rl7yzuo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./colin-yeager-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>yeahcolin - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thomas-browne-henry-net-worth-64867.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Thomas Browne Henry Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
