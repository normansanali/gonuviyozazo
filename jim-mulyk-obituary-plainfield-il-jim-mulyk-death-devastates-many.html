He took his last breath at Lake Winona Manor, where he had been a resident. Born as Jim Duellman on October 11, 1934, to his parents Alphonse and Evelyn (Drazkowski) in Winona, Minnesota, his journey through life was marked by unwavering dedication to family, service, and a myriad of talents.</p><p>Jim Duellman’s love story began on May 17, 1958, when he married Evelyn Theresa Ashelin at St. Mary’s Catholic Church in Winona, Minnesota. Together, they embarked on a remarkable journey of life and love. As a man of deep faith, Jim remained a devoted attendee of the Catholic Church of St. Casimir throughout his life. His religious convictions played a significant role in shaping his character and the way he approached life’s challenges.</p><p>Jim’s professional life was nothing short of diverse. While he possessed a wide array of skills and talents, he was primarily an Independent Contractor with Dart Transit for the entirety of his working career. His dedication and work ethic earned him the respect and admiration of those he worked with, and his years at Dart Transit became an integral part of his life’s story.</p><p>However, before he embarked on his career as an independent contractor, Jim Duellman began his journey into the world of service and patriotism. He initially joined the United States Army, where he served with unwavering dedication. Later, he transferred to the United States Army National Guard, where he continued to excel. His commitment and hard work were rewarded, and he achieved the prestigious rank of E-8/First Sergeant.</p><p>Yet, Jim’s life was not defined by his career alone. He was also a loving and devoted father who placed great importance on instilling strong values in his children. He worked tirelessly to ensure that they developed a strong work ethic and a never-give-up attitude that would serve them well throughout their lives. Jim’s family was a source of pride and joy for him, and his influence on their lives is immeasurable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKKZonquwcuyomankp7Btq3RsmSppJGeu6e1xKWbZqGcYrequYymrKWxm2Kxpq3ToWSdnaaWwLWt056qZqWRo8Zw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jorja-curtright.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jorja Curtright Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./james-trafford-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-499198-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>James Trafford Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
