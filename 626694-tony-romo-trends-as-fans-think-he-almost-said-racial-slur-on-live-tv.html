Of course, this matchup featured the <a href=# rel>Kansas City Chiefs and the Cincinnati Bengals</a>. In the end, the Chiefs won 23-20. However, it was one of Romo's calls that got most of the attention on social media.</p><p>Former NFL quarterback Tony Romo poses after winning the American Century Championship at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course on July 10, 2022 in Stateline, Nevada.

Subsequently, videos were posted with an analysis of what Romo may have or may not have been trying to say.</p><p>Down in the video below, you can hear Romo say that the Chiefs player was surrounded. However, he eventually made an "N" sound before catching himself and saying something else. Consequently, he had people thinking that he was about let the n-word slip.</p><p>In the ensuing tweets, even more, fans came through with the very same analysis. Many struggled to think of what he could have been trying to say. Some theorized "nickels," while others thought he was confused and wanted to say "Niners." Either way, this is one of those situations that Romo may very well have to address at some point.</p><p>At this point, it remains to be seen what will come of this. CBS nor Romo have issued a response. Either way, fans are going to continue circulating this clip as they try to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>Let us know what you thought happened here, in the comments below.
