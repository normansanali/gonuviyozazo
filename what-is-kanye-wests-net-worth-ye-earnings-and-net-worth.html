Here’s what Ye’s net worth looks like as we approach 2023.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-rise data-injectable=false>The rise</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/kanye-west-yeezy-sex-tape.jpg><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>Although Ye generated extraordinary wealth from his music, his biggest score was Adidas. The rapper began producing Yeezy sneakers for the company in 2015, which grossed billions and made him the highest-paid musician and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">second-highest-paid celebrity</a> behind Kylie Jenner. In 2020, Forbes listed Ye’s net worth as $1 billion, which Ye contested, proclaiming, “It’s $3.3 billion since no one at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a> knows how to count.” By 2022, his Forbes-estimated fortune had ballooned to $2 billion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The fall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kanye-West-Podcast.jpg><p data-characters=826 data-current-count=1126 data-injectable=true>“I lost 2 billion dollars in one day,” Ye <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Oct. 27</a> after Adidas, Balenciaga, and numerous other companies dropped him for his antisemitism. If Ye was exaggerating, it was slight, as Forbes estimated that he had forfeited $1.5 billion on his Adidas termination alone. Despite Yeezy products accounting for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">up to eight percent of Adidas’s revenue</a>, the company announced that Ye’s remarks were “unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company’s values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness,” which caused it to “end production of Yeezy branded products and stop all payments to Ye and his companies.” Adidas <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">predicted a quarter-billion-dollar loss in 2022</a> as a result of the separation, but that is nothing compared to Ye’s loss.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Yeezus going into 2023</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kanye-west-music.jpg><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=802 data-injectable=false>As of Dec. 30, 2022, Ye’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated net worth is $400.1 million</a>. Absent his lucrative business partners, the 45-year-old’s fortune consists of his music, cash, real estate, and “skimming” from ex-wife Kim Kardashian’s company, Skims (he owns a five percent stake). 2023 remains a big question mark for Ye, not just regarding his finances, but his sanity, presidential bid, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and his very whereabouts</a>. We’re intrigued and nervous to bring in the new year with new Ye.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZuWu7qxjLCcrKyjYrumwIywpqusmGLGpnnEmqmnoZ6cwG6tzZ1kp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./5-letter-words-ending-in-sh-wordle-game-help.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>5 Letter Words Ending in SH Wordle Game Help</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./video-an-alleged-fake-mr-bean-spotted-in-zimbabwe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>VIDEO: An Alleged Fake Mr. Bean Spotted In Zimbabwe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
