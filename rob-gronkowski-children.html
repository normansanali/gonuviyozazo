He was named to the All-Western New York first team and the All-State second team.</p><p>Gronkowski was a member of the National Honor Society, and his strongest subject was math, while English was his weakest.</p><p>Gronkowski relocated to the Pittsburgh suburbs in 2006, where he graduated from Woodland Hills High School. The Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League initially ruled him ineligible due to his transfer, but after the ruling was overturned, he recorded eight receptions for 152 yards and four touchdowns at Woodland Hills.</p><p>He was a SuperPrep All-American, a PrepStar All-American, an Associated Press Class 4-A all-state selection, a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette “Fabulous 22,” a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette first-team all-conference selection, a Patriot-News “Platinum 33,” and a Pittsburgh Tribune-Review “Terrific 25” selection.</p><p>He had offers from Kentucky, Arizona, Clemson, Louisville, Maryland, Ohio State, and Syracuse. Gronkowski graduated from Woodland Hills High School in 2007 with a 3.75 grade point average and a SAT score of 1560 out of 2400.</p><p>After high school, Gronkowski played football for the Arizona Wildcats under head coach Mike Stoops while enrolling at the University of Arizona as a Pre-Business major. In 2007, he had 28 receptions for 525 yards as a freshman.</p><p>Following a draft day trade with the Oakland Raiders, Gronkowski was selected by the New England Patriots with the 42nd overall pick in the second round of the 2010 NFL Draft. According to Raiders scouts’ pre-draft rankings, which were made public in May 2016, Gronkowski was the “best all-around player in the draft.”</p><p>After nine seasons and at the age of 29, Gronkowski retired from the NFL on March 24, 2019, according to an Instagram post. Five months later, he provided more details about his choice, stating that the discomfort and injuries he had experienced throughout his career had negatively impacted his mental health.</p><p>In order to obtain a compensatory fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, the Patriots, who still held Gronkowski’s rights, traded him to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on April 21, 2020, along with a seventh-round pick.</p><p>Gronkowski re-signed with the Buccaneers on March 22, 2021, for a $10 million, one-year contract. On June 21, 2022, Gronkowski made a second retirement announcement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rob Gronkowski Children: Does Rob Gronkowski Have Children?</h2><p>As of the year 2022, Rob Gronkowski was not known to have any children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqumm2WXp7yvt86wqqShXZi1qrjDq5ynZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./samaire-armstrong-movies-husband-body-career-net-worth-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Samaire Armstrong Movies, Husband, Body, Career &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicholas-stoller-net-worth-75811.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicholas Stoller Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
