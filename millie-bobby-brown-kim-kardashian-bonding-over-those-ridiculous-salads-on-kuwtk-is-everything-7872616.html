On Thursday, Stranger Things star <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Millie Bobby Brown tweeted about the Kardashians</a> and made clear that it's among her dreams to chow down on some greens with the Keeping Up With The Kardashians stars. Kim Kardashian rushed to the rescue saying that she could make her dream come true. It’s not the first time that <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Brown and the Kardashians have expressed their love</a> for one another, either.</p><p>Brown who is a self-proclaimed fan of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>tweeted out her hopes and dreams on Thursday</a>: “Honestly, all I want is for Kourtney K to shake my salad.” She was probably watching any given episode of the show, as<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> the Kardashians are avid salad eaters and shakers</a>, so much so that the Kardashian Salad Shake has become an infamous move.</p><p>Kim was quick to come through for Eleven, quote tweeting her and responding: “I can arrange this!" And, according to People, Brown’s salad-shaker of choice<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> Kourtney screen-shotted the 13-year-old's tweet </a>and put it in her Instagram story, adding some sweet pink handwritten text over it saying “Anytime.”</p><p>It seems like Brown’s got something in common with Eleven and can make just about anything happen, as she is soon to be a salad shaker. She responded back to Kim: “<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>KIM! Grab your calendar it’s happenin</a>. My dream has come true.”</p><p>And when Brown said it was her dream, she wasn't kidding. She’s expressed her unconditional love for Keeping Up With the Kardashians before. Back in November in an interview on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Brown made clear how much she loves the show</a>. “I love them, I really do!" she told Fallon, who seemed pretty bemused at her fandom. She went on:</p>"I'm obsessed with them. I follow them on social media. I think that they are just like really great. They're so entertaining. They have their own like language. Like instead of saying, 'I swear', they're like ‘Bible!' And then they're like, ‘Okurrr!' It means like OK. It's like, ‘Okurrr!'"<p>Her impressions were spot on, by the way. And the Kardashians took notice and declared that the love was mutual, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>sending Brown into a tizzy</a>. Khloé Kardashian tweeted a clip of the video, adding, "It's a mutual love fest!! I LOVE you @milliebbrown! #Okurrrrttt this video made me smile from ear to ear BIBLE." This was just a day after Khloé was tweeting about watching Stranger Things for the first time and totally loving it.</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Kris Jenner took notice, too</a>, tweeting: "I love you @milliebbrown, you are so adorable! Thanks for watching #KUWTK! We are huge fans of yours also!!" Brown was on a flight when she got these amazing responses but even if she were on the ground she'd be floating, anyway.</p><p>And while<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> Kourtney was already obsessed Stranger Things</a>, Kim tweeted that she was just starting the show later in November, writing, "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>I feel like I'm going to be up all night trying to watch it all!</a>" Brown was thrilled, of course, as she herself loves to marathon KUWTK. She had even said earlier that it was the only thing that Eleven watched on the Stranger Things set.</p><p>So, it looks like a Millie Bobby Brown-Kardashians meet-and-greet and salad shake is inevitable! Brown didn't say why Kourtney is her salad shaker of choice, but maybe she just admired her technique the most. They all adore each other, that is for sure. Let the salad shaking and marathon-watching commence.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jqagpaSZmnqju8GbsGaaoqTEr3nKoqRmo5GnsaK%2Fx6KYp2WSpLultc2gZKiulad6tbTOrJxmqpmZtqTBy6isrGWjlrmisNJmpqdlm6rEtbeMoqpmnaaav7rAx6KloGVnbYRzgpBv</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./neil-patrick-harris-magic-acting-therapy-parenting.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Neil Patrick Harris on Magic and Acting, Therapy and Parenting</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-isiah-pacheco-brother-travoise-cannon.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Isiah Pacheco Brother, Travoise Cannon</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
