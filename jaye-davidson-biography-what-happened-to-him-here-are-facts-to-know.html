He is perhaps best known for his role as the transgender woman, Dil in the 1992 suspense-drama thriller, The Crying Game. For his role in the movie, Davidson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Two years later, in 1994, he played the role of Ra in the movie, Stargate. In addition to acting, the American-born English actor is also a model. Let’s tell you more about the real Jaye Davidson you never knew; including his rumored gay status. Enjoy</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jaye-davidsons-biography></span><strong>Jaye Davidson’s Biography</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jaye Davidson was born Alfred Amey in Riverside, California, United States, on March 21, 1968, to an African father (a Ghanaian) and an English mother. When Jaye was just two, his family left the United States for England. There, he spent the most part of his childhood in Hertfordshire, England, UK.</p><p>Although there are too few details chronicling his early life, education, siblings or what his parents did for a living, we know he began schooling but dropped out at age 16 and was involved in several menial jobs. Sources believe he even worked as a fashion designer, before delving into acting.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><strong>Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When he began acting, Davidson had no professional training or prior experience in acting. He was more of a stroke of fate and fortune. The youngster was discovered at a wrap party for Derek Jarman’s Edward II and got an invite to audition for The Crying Game movie project. Good for Davidson, he was cast in the role of a transgender woman, Dil. This shot him to fame as The Crying Game received huge critical acclaim and became an overnight success.</p><p>For his role in the film, Jaye Davidson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in 1993. Trailing that were nominations for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actor and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actors both in 1993.</p><p>The following year, 1994, Jaye Davidson appeared as an alien impersonating the Sun god, Ra, in the Sci-Fi adventure film Stargate. After starring as a Nazi Photographer in the 2009 film, The Borghild Project, Davidson retired from acting on personal grounds. In a later interview, he stated that he genuinely hated the fame he was beginning to receive. In the years that followed, Davidson gave more attention to modeling. And has so far worked on several high-profile photo shoots in recent years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-him></span><strong>What Happened To Him? </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It was in 2009 that he was last seen in a movie. Jaye Davidson’s early retirement came as a shock to many of his fans and admirers. But for others, they’ve smelt the big withdrawal years earlier. For one, Davidson, hardly considers himself an actor. Also, he doesn’t do so so well with the spotlight. And so it came as no surprise when he called it quits in 2009 to pursue a different career – modeling. But that wouldn’t stop the paparazzi from trailing him. Since retiring, Davidson has morphed from his famous androgynous looks into a masculine build; as he now rocks tattoos and has since ‘gymed’ out his muscles. An incredible transformation, if you ask.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-facts-to-know-about-jaye-davidson></span> <strong>Other Facts To Know about </strong><strong>Jaye Davidson</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h4><strong>1. Net Worth</strong></h4><p>As of 2019, sources reveal Jaye Davidson’s net worth to be over $1.5 million. Much of which has come from his acting and modeling career. Although we are not sure how much he earns, sources say that he charged a whopping $1 million for the movie, Stargate. Davidson didn’t want to appear in the film at all, he says. And so he quoted such high pay, which interestingly, producers agreed to. Perhaps, this wouldn’t have been possible save for his celebrity status from The Crying Game. Although it was his first appearance, his incredible performance in The Crying Game earned him #92 on Premiere Magazine’s “100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time.”</p><h4><strong>2. Height and Body Measurement</strong></h4><p>Now over fifty, Jaye Davidson still maintains a little of his androgynous looks even though he has since transitioned into a traditionally masculine look; with a shaved head, a more muscular physique and tattoos. He stands 5 feet 3 inches (1.6 meters) tall and weighs around 132 lbs (60 kg). He has shaved off his once-long black hair and has dark-brown eyes. Sadly, there are no verified details about his shoe and dress sizes, as well as his body measurements. We are sure to put them all out for you as soon as we get the specifics.</p><h4><strong>3. Social Media Following</strong></h4><p>As far as specifics go, Jaye Davidson is not on social media, neither does he operate any Instagram, Facebook or Twitter accounts.</p><h4><strong>4.
