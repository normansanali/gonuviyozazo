One such iconic theme song is “Booyaka 619” by Jim Johnston, which became synonymous with the high-flying luchador Rey Mysterio. As a fan of both Rey Mysterio and his entrance theme, I can’t help but get pumped up whenever I hear those catchy lyrics and energetic beats.</p><h3>The Lyrics:</h3><p>“Booyaka, booyaka, 6-1-9 (Hey!)<br>Booyaka, booyaka, that’s my pueblo!<br>Booyaka, booyaka, 6-1-9 (Hey!)<br>Booyaka, booyaka, Rey Mysterio”</p><p>The chorus of the song sets the stage for Rey Mysterio’s entrance, with the repeated chants of “booyaka” and the mention of the numbers 6-1-9, which is both Rey Mysterio’s signature move (the 619) and his area code representing San Diego. The lyrics celebrate Mysterio’s Mexican heritage and his connection to his hometown, making it a powerful anthem for both the wrestler and his fans.</p><p>“Ya llego el Rey Mysterio<br>Vato cabrón de San Diego<br>Flash up on the scene like a brown crusader<br>Blowin’ up screens like Space Invaders”</p><p>In the first verse, the lyrics highlight Rey Mysterio’s arrival and his status as the “Rey” or king of the wrestling world. The lines also pay homage to his San Diego roots and describe him as a superhero-like figure, making reference to his high-flying moves and his impact on the wrestling industry.</p><p>“Making universal, speakin’ English<br>The way we flip it is hard to distinguish<br>Booyaka, booyaka, el reguetón<br>Mic check, mic check, 1, 2, it’s on”</p><p>The third verse emphasizes Mysterio’s ability to connect with fans worldwide, transcending language barriers. It shows his versatility and adaptability in different wrestling styles, as well as his love for reggaeton music. The lyrics further emphasize the excitement and energy Mysterio brings to the ring.</p><h3>The Additional Information:</h3><p>Jim Johnston, the renowned composer behind many iconic WWE entrance themes, including “Booyaka 619,” created a song that perfectly captures the essence of Rey Mysterio’s character. The collaboration with Rey Mysterio and Mad One resulted in a theme song that became synonymous with Mysterio’s high-flying style and connection to his Mexican heritage.</p><p>The song was initially released on September 16, 2005, as the theme song for Rey Mysterio on WWE Smackdown. It features Rey Mysterio and Mad One, with music and production by Jim Johnston.</p><p>Notably, “Booyaka 619” samples “Bad Boys” by Inner Circle and has inspired covers by artists like P.O.D. The song has become a defining part of Rey Mysterio’s legacy and continues to resonate with fans around the world.</p><p>In conclusion, “Booyaka 619” is more than just a catchy entrance theme song. It represents Rey Mysterio’s identity, his Mexican heritage, and his high-flying style in the wrestling world. It has become an anthem for both Mysterio and his fans, symbolizing his connection with San Diego and the excitement he brings to the ring. Whenever I hear those familiar lyrics, it takes me back to some incredible wrestling moments and reminds me of the impact Rey Mysterio has had on the industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jq2fnmWdmq6vtc2gZJudmJ67pXnToZxmq5%2BjtG6uzqiwmqORYoNyhYybsGaimaJ6q7vHp6qtp55k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sophie-flays-mother-age-wiki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Sophie Flays Mother?
