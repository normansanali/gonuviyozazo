Playing as a point guard, Jeremy is currently playing with <i>Kaohsiung 17LIVE Steelers</i> of the P. League+. In NBA he signed with teams like <i>New York Knicks, Huston Rockets, Los Angeles Lakers, Brooklyn Nets,</i> and <i>Atlanta Hawks</i>.</p><p>Lin was born on <strong>August 23, 1988</strong>. Raised in Torrance, California. He is a dual American and Taiwanese citizen and belongs to a mixed-racial Asian community. He is the child of <strong>Shirley Lin</strong> and <strong>Gie-Ming Lin</strong>.<strong> </strong>His star sign is Leo.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, Jeremy Lin was born in a Catholic family in the San Francisco Bay Area of Palo Alto. His parents emigrated from Taiwan to the United States in the mid-1970s.</p><h2>Is Jeremy Lin Single or Married?</h2><p>The 6 feet 3 inches tall point guard was previously one of the most eligible bachelors in the Basketball world. However, all that changed in January 2023 when Jeremy announced to the world that <strong>he had married his wife</strong> in 2020. He did keep this relationship hidden from the press for years to protect his privacy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/15/gvgvjh-1586940059155.JPG><p>He kept his private life a secret as long as he could. His leading lady is<a href=# rel=nofollow> possibly Kristina Wong</a>, &nbsp;a performance artist.</p><h2>Previous Love Life Of Jeremy</h2><p>Jeremy has kept his love life hidden. But he also has a record of loving someone special in the past.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2012, Jeremy's former Harvard basketball teammate and colleague, <strong>Alek Blankenau</strong>, told the GQ that he once had a faithful girlfriend in college. According to him:</p><p>Jeremy had once forgotten to make reservations on Valentine's Day and had to save the day with some homemade chicken parm. He's not a lot of a guy to cook anything, but his roommates helped out and placed a pleasant meal together by the time it was all over.</p><p>But unfortunately, the information about Lin's former girlfriend isn't out yet. But the named woman is probably not his wife but an ex-girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><h3>Kim Kardashian Was Once Interested In Jeremy Lin</h3><p>At the height of <i><strong>Linsanity</strong></i>, Kim Kardashian once made headlines when she publicly said that she really thinks "Jeremy IS CUTE". It was 2012, and at that time Kim was the friend of <a href=#><strong>Carmelo Anthony</strong></a><strong>'</strong>s wife<strong> Lala</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, Carmelo and Jeremy were teammates at the time and Carmelo was said to have resented Lin for his fame. &nbsp;And in one of Kim's interviews Kim Kardashian said;</p><p>I think Jeremy Is really cute and his the friend of Carmelo. So it will be nice if we went for a double date.&nbsp;</p><p>In response to the rumors, Jeremy stated that the pair never dated. They did meet up before but they never had anything romantic.</p><h2>$1 Million Pledge By Jeremy Lin For COVID-19 Relief</h2><p>The United States of America is the new Epicenter of Coronavirus as of April 2020. In a time like this, NBA player Jeremy Lin, the first Asian-American to capture the NBA championship, <a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>promised</strong></a><strong> </strong>up to <strong>$1 million</strong> pledge&nbsp;in coronavirus aid.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/5/19/unknown_300767942_149331177725067_7899732196998945513_n%20(1)-1684490022292.jpg><p>Meanwhile, the 31-year-old, whose 2012 valiant <i>New York Knicks</i> years are dubbed "Linsanity," would contribute <strong>$500,000</strong> and added that he will also support contributions up to an extra <strong>$500,000</strong>.</p><p>This is not the first time Jeremy Lin came forward in for social welfare, On October 26, 2016, he contributed <strong>$1,000,000</strong> to Harvard University to support the Lavietes Pavilion student financial aid and renewal.</p><p>He has also spoken out against the discrimination and violence that many Asian Americans are facing in the country.</p><h2>Net Worth: How Much Does Jeremy Lin Earn?</h2><p>Jeremy Lin has an estimated net worth of about <strong>$36 million</strong>. But he has made more than $60 million from his basketball career in his contracts. He has a long history in NBA before joining the CBA.&nbsp;</p><p>After he was drafted from the <i>New York Knicks</i> to <i>Houston Rockets</i>, he signed a massive<strong> $25 million</strong> contract for 3 years. &nbsp;Later on, he was transferred to <i>Charlotte</i> for 2 years after signing<strong> </strong>a <strong>$4.47 million</strong> worth contract.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, In 2016, considering his performance and consistency NBA giant team <i>Brooklyn Nets</i> signed Jeremy for 3 years with a jaw-dropping contract valued<strong> </strong>at <strong>$38.3 million</strong>. Meanwhile, while Brooklyn renewed his contract in 2018 he received <strong>$12.5 million.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/4/15/hcfyuy-1586939876687.JPG><p>According to <i>Spotarc</i>, Jeremy Lin has appeared for a total of 9 seasons in the NBA, and perhaps by accumulating the contract amount he has earned a staggering <strong>$64.49 million </strong>in total.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, talking about his salary then, we must have to say he was one of the highest-earning players in the NBA just like <a href=#><strong>Sarunas Jackson</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In addition to that, Lin's current deal with the &nbsp;Kaohsiung 17LIVE Steelers is estimated to give him an income of<strong> $3 million </strong>a year.</p><h2>Sponsorship And Endorsement Deals Of Jeremy</h2><p>Even though Jeremy received so many offers for endorsements, he declined several of the endorsement packages. He claimed that, at the height of his success, he declined hundreds of millions of dollars in sponsorship offers. In one of his interviews, he stated that;</p><p>&nbsp;"I guess my intention is to play basketball, play well, and play for the glory of God," he said. Lin found the basketball company "definitely secondary to my primary employment."</p><p>To now, he has sponsored Volvo, Nike (2010-14), Steiner Sports, and since 2014, he is still the famous face of Adidas. Through these endorsement deals, he must've gained millions of dollars.</p><h2>Why did Jeremy Leave the NBA?</h2><p>Jeremy Lin left the NBA in August 2019 and signed with the Beijing Ducks in the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). According to him, race played a part in his decision.</p><p>In his pursuit of a comeback in the NBA, Jeremy Lin made his way back to the court in 2021 as a part of the Warriors' development team.&nbsp;</p><figure class=media></figure><p>However, he eventually decided to return to the CBA, where he initially played for the Ducks and later joined the Guangzhou Loong Lions.</p><p>Now he plays for the Kaohsiung 17LIVE Steelers of the P.
