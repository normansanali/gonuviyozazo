Is it actually any good?</strong></p><p id=eW9THoStvYz data-wc=31>I had the privilege of watching the first episodes alongside <a class=hm-link href=#>the Beckham family</a> at the Curzon Mayfair ahead of its official release on 4 October. Keep reading for my honest review…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/819cc8d3becd-gettyimages-498473394.jpg><p id=e1-PGp9p4tD data-wc=75>As someone who writes about the Beckhams on a fairly regular basis, I didn't anticipate being able to glean any new nuggets of information. The couple are still firmly in the limelight thanks in part to David's success with Inter Miami CF and VB's hugely influential fashion brand… and to top it all off, the entire Beckham clan are big on social media. In short, it's pretty darn easy to keep up with the Beckhams.</p><p id=eSbXVPS9udV data-wc=53>And yet, I have to confess, I did leave the movie theatre having learnt something new. David and VB shared their first kiss in a car park?! Who would have thought? And VB casually admitted that "she wasn't into football then, [and isn't] into football now." I'm with you on that one, Victoria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/29ec3dacaf35-screenshot-2023-09-20-at-160711.png><p id=eirpp9QnuxI data-wc=38>The first episode kicks off [pun absolutely intended] with the former professional footballer tending to his beloved bees whilst decked out in a full beekeeper suit. Keep your eyes peeled for the embroidered 'DB' initials in gold stitching.</p><p id=eWYgR02lsos data-wc=28>"There's a bit of an argument in the house at the moment. I think it should be 'Golden Bees,' David reveals, before adding: "Victoria likes 'DB's Sticky Stuff.'"</p><p id=e3v9FgBolRJ data-wc=37>After a quick giggle, we're then catapulted back in time to David's early football career. We witness his sensational halfway-line goal which ultimately thrust him into the limelight and paved the way for his illustrious sporting career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd91863de4e3-david-beckham-manchester-united-trophy.jpg><p id=euEYMnL66ov data-wc=19>Aside from gripping never-before-seen footage, the Beckham docuseries comes alive thanks to the addition of a few familiar faces.</p><p id=eoSUD73WwlR data-wc=46>To name just a few, we meet David's parents Ted and Sandra, Alex Ferguson, Eric Catona, Gary Neville, Mel C, Anna Wintour, Rio Ferdinand and Paul Ince. They offer candid insights into David and Victoria's life away from the spotlight and add a sprinkling of humour.&nbsp;</p><p id=ed-Jwx9M-Pp data-wc=39>Moving onto VB. It was refreshing to see the fashion mogul let her guard down and delve into her childhood. Whilst she's renowned for her 'no smiling' rule, the mother-of-four came across as more relatable than you might think.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd8f41a138c0-gettyimages-919576816.jpg><p id=e6Q-6ZyfZeB data-wc=23>Speaking about her struggles in the spotlight, she reveals: "I never found it as easy as the other girls… to be that outgoing.</p><p id=et1t31TkeJTh data-wc=47><strong>"I was always quite shy. I was never the popular kid at school. I was actually bullied quite a lot. And I probably would still be that way if I hadn't met the girls. And what the Spice Girls did is they brought me out of me."</strong></p><p id=efrnXH-_aR data-wc=60>The second episode takes a closer look at David's mental health struggles in the wake of the '98 World Cup. We get a real sense of what he had to put up with – and quite honestly, in a time when mental health wasn't prioritised in the workplace, I was blown away by his seemingly stalwart disposition and dogged determination.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3304cc485db2-gettyimages-1715810397.jpg><p id=eGRmdCXV6P data-wc=36>We're given a glimpse inside their experience as first-time parents, in addition to never-before-seen footage of their extravagant wedding held in Ireland. Even VB was left a bit speechless by the wonderfully wacky purple wedding attire...&nbsp;</p><p id=eIb8ZSViha data-wc=22>David describes his documentary as a<strong>&nbsp;"love letter to football and to his family."</strong> And it most certainly delivers on all fronts.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3JdS6Ml2blT data-wc=64>Downsides? It would have been nice to see a few further glimpses inside their house. Whilst the green velvet set-up is visually very aesthetic, I would have loved to have seen a few more snippets of their unfiltered and unpolished family life. Beyond this, it is quite football-heavy... so if you're not remotely interested in the sport, then this one maybe isn't for you.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
