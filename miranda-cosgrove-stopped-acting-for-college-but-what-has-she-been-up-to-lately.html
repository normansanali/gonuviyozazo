"I feel like I'm not the kind of person that would just go up to somebody and introduce myself, so it's helped me in a lot of ways.”</p><p>Taking the opportunity to attend college was important for Cosgrove, who explained that dedicating several years of her life to a course she felt passionate about helped her understand what she wanted to do later on in her career.</p><p>It also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taught her a lot about self-discipline</a>.</p><p>"College really does help you grow up and figure out who you are. So, it's just helped me grow as a person, like even just getting to classes on time and figuring out where classes are.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cosgrove returned to work on the horror-mystery The Intruders in 2015, starring Hudgen’s ex-boyfriend Austin Butler, but the movie was anything but a box office hit, with critics calling it the motion picture predictable and unoriginal.</p><p>In 2016, however, it appeared as if the former Nickelodeon star’s career was back on track when she landed a recurring role as Shea Moore in the short-lived NBC series Crowded.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadway, Nickelodeon & More: What Ariana Grande Did Before Becoming A Pop Star</a></span></p><p>The TV show looked promising and certainly had potential, but for reasons concerning its lackluster ratings, the network decided not to order a follow-up season, consequently leaving Cosgrove to find new acting gigs in Hollywood.</p><p>The following year, she starred in Despicable Me 3 where she played Margo. The family flick has been Cosgrove’s biggest film in well over a decade, having grossed a whopping $1 billion at the box office, with a fourth installment already said to be in development.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s unclear whether Cosgrove will return for another film in the popular franchise.</p><p>The Leave It All To Me singer went on to appear in several TV movies before landing her next motion picture in 2019, titled 3022. It was another low-budget film with not-so-positive reviews, making it evident that Cosgrove was either booking the wrong jobs or she was simply having a harder time landing the right roles.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Believe Britney Spears’ Profile Picture On IG Is ‘Proof’ She’s Crying Out For Freedom</a></span></p><p>Her career slowing down over the years could also be due to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the scary 2011 bus crash that the pop star was involved in</a> while promoting her debut album on Dancing Crazy Tour.
