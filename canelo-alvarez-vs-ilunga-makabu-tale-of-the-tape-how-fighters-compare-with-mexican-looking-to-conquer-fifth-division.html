the nod to move up to cruiserweight to challenge champion Ilunga Makabu.</p><p>The WBC announced at their annual convention that they have given their blessing for <a href=#>Makabu to defend his title against the Mexican.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Showtime-Canelo-v-Plant-PPV-Vegas-Fight-Night-WESTCOTT-63.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000694305776.jpg><p>Canelo is already a four-division champion, having won belts from light-middleweight <a href=#>all the way to light-heavyweight.</a></p><p>But he appears to have a FIFTH weight class eyed after requesting to fight Makabu, who was knocked out by Tony Bellew in 2016.</p><p>Here, SunSport compares the two fighters.</p><h2>SPEED</h2><p>Canelo is one of the most destructive combination punchers in the sport, letting fly with beautiful shots in numbers.</p><p>But his hands are not always eye-catching, as he instead focuses more on accuracy and timing.</p><p>That being said, he is by far the speedier puncher than Makabu, who does still poses quick hands for his size.</p><p>Neither men have particularly sharp feet, but Canelo is always on the move and often cuts off the ring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/f1f48870-c110-46ff-b4d0-20acbc592f5a.jpg><h2>POWER</h2><p>Canelo has heavy hands, with 39 knockouts in his 57 wins, and importantly carries his power into the later rounds.</p><p>That was on shown when he beat Sergey Kovalev for the WBO light-heavyweight title, which he won in round 11.</p><p>If he is to use similar tactics to take Makabu out late, that power will be vital to breaking down the Congolese veteran.</p><p>But due to the size different, Makabu will carry a power advantage, taking 25 KOs into the fight from 28 won.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000691953845-1.jpg><h2>EXPERIENCE</h2><p>Despite Makabu, 34, being three years older, Canelo, 31, has exactly double the amount of fights.</p><p>Not many other fighters can claim to have more experience than Canelo, who <a href=#>amazingly turned professional at just 15.</a></p><p>He has also shared the ring with some of the best in his era, including Floyd Mayweather, Miguel Cotto, Gennady Golovkin and Kovalev.</p><p>And for Makabu, he has been involved in just three world titles fight, with only his 2016 loss to Bellew a recognised name on his record.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/41c0490a-7961-4972-ab90-1699e7413f45.jpg><h2>RECORD</h2><p>Canelo’s one loss as a 23-year-old in 2013 against Mayweather proved a turning point in his career, as he seemed to adapt and improve his style thereafter.</p><p>But he was deemed fortunate to walk away with a draw against GGG in 2017 and a win in their rematch a year later.</p><p>Having also faced the best all the way from 154-175lb, Canelo has almost seen it all in the ring.</p><p>And Makabu’s lack of established opponents on his resume makes for comfortable viewing for Alvarez.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NINTCHDBPICT000274464698.jpg><h2>PHYSIQUE</h2><p>Makabu carries in a height and reach advantage, standing 6ft compared to 5ft 9in Canelo, and has an almost four inch reach advantage.</p><p>But they were almost <a href=#>identical stats in Plant’s favour</a>, before the American was knocked out with a round to go.</p><p>Makabu is also over TWO STONE heavier than Canelo if you compare their last fights, which were two weights apart.</p><p>He does also have a southpaw stance, but that did not help Billy Joe Saunders, who was left with FOUR face fractures in May after losing in round eight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
