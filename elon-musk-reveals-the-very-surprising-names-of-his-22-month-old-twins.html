Elon took to social media with a message addressing Amber in which he said there was still "love" between them.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFhxJvGmIz data-wc=61>"Btw, just to clear up some of the press storms this weekend, although Amber and I did break up, we are still friends, remain close and love one another," Elon tweeted at the time, according to PageSix.
