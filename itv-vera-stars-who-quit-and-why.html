The actor first left the show in 2014 and said he was thrilled to make his <strong>comeback at DS Joe Ashworth</strong>. But why did he leave in the first place?</p><p id=eOwN9H4qeA data-wc=21>We've taken a look back at some of the old cast members <strong>who have left Vera and where they are today.</strong></p><p id=eO_Zyl6HXA data-wc=12><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Unforgotten: ITV reveals future of drama following dramatic series five finale</a></strong></p><p id=eEhg9VoqVi data-wc=11><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Grace star John Simm reveals future of popular ITV drama</a></strong></p><h2>Kenny Doughty</h2><p id=eUF_485Ga0 data-wc=62>Last month, Kenny shared the news on social media that he was leaving his role as Aiden Healy behind. "I want to thank everyone who’s made this amazing time so joyous, ITV, Silverprint, all the brilliant cast and crew BUT of course my buddy & inspiration Brenda Blethyn. The perfect leading star who I owe so much to," he said in part.</p><p id=eVqwk1D8O_ data-wc=32>It's thought that the actor is stepping away from the role to concentrate on other projects. Fans were quick to wish him well for the future and luck for his upcoming roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/484a1a190286-veraseries11episode312.jpg><h2>David Leon</h2><p id=e4B8dSdBQO data-wc=85>David Leon was a regular cast member when the first show aired and Vera's partner, Joe Ashworth. However, the actor walked away from the role in 2014 after four seasons. David, who also works as a producer and director, left the show to pursue other commitments, leaving Brenda "heartbroken" in the process. She told the Mirror: "I never thought I'd get over David leaving. That broke my heart." Upon his return, Brenda said she was "over the moon" to welcome back her old cast mate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/5fee594d9ca2-shutterstockeditorial3310243dv.jpg><h2>Cush Jumbo</h2><p id=eXzduvmJ5k data-wc=71>Cush played DS Bethany Whelan in series two, five and six and ITV's Vera. Her character was killed off by a suspect, so it's perhaps unsurprising that the actress didn't then make a return to the show. The star left Vera to work on major projects in the States. Since leaving the ITV drama, she's appeared in shows such as The Good Wife on CBS and its spin-off, The Good Fight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/57f195b47fe8-gettyimages-495295494.jpg><h2>Clare Calbraith</h2><p id=e9BQjudvH_ data-wc=52>Throughout series three and four, Clare Calbraith played the part of DS Rebecca 'Shep' Shepherd. For series five, Clare was replaced by Cush Jumbo's character, Bethany Whelan. Clare would then go onto focus on other acting roles. She's known for her credits in shows like Unforgotten, Downton Abbey, Grace, Baptiste and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6e241e44d9b5-shutterstockeditorial12652336k.jpg><h2>Kingsley Ben-Adir</h2><p id=eRtXvj_Kal data-wc=87>Kingsley Ben-Adir was a regular cast member on Vera between series four and six and again in series eight. He played the part of Dr Marcus Sumner, but left the show to head to Hollywood – and it looks like he made it! In 2020, Kingsley appeared in the role as Malcolm X in the Oscar-nominated movie One Night In Miami alongside Leslie Odom Jr. and the late Lance Reddick. He's also set to appear in Greta Gerwig's upcoming Barbie movie alongside Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/102c4eda02ae-shutterstockeditorial9299998aq.jpg><h2>Sonya Cassidy</h2><p id=ezkuMaJb15K data-wc=63>Sonya Cassidy played the part of David Leon's on-screen wife, Celine Ashworth, between seasons two and four. It's not known why Sonya left the role but given David's exit, it may not have come as a surprise to fans of Vera that the scripts meant Celine would leave with her husband. Since then, she's appeared in Lodge 49, Humans and The Last Kingdom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/0d7215f1d856-gettyimages-1165642842.jpg><h2>Wunmi Mosaku</h2><p id=egR8d3G8G2 data-wc=32>DC Holly Lawson, who appeared in the first two season of Vera, was played by Wunmi Mosaku. After appearing the role between 2011 and 2012, she went to pursue other projects Stateside.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/5daade0f2562-gettyimages-683071648.jpg><p id=e95e2YvfAGL data-wc=17>Wunmi now has credits in MCU television series, Loki, HBO's Lovecraft Country and the film, Alice, Darling.</p><p id=er1r--j9SH data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tb3JpZG58qsDVZq2eqpFiwLWt0axksKCfYr62tdNmmKecXay1uns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-wakanda-forevers-meaning-and-origin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is Wakanda Forevers meaning and origin?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-murdoch-family-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Murdoch Family Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
