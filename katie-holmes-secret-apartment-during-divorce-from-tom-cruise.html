Holmes said of first seeing Cruise, "I knew in an instant that we were going to be together, that we were going to get married."Tom and Katie were dubbed "TomKat" by the media and were known for their huge PDA sessions on the red carpet. Cruise infamously <a href=#>jumped on Oprah's couch</a> declaring his love for the stunning brunette.

The ceremony was attended by some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including the likes of Victoria Beckham, Jennifer Lopez, John Travolta, and former Scientologist, Leah Remini. Seven months later, their daughter Suri was born on April 18, 2006.But in 2012, fans couldn't help but notice that Holmes was not by Cruise's side at the premiere of his latest film Rock Of Ages.
