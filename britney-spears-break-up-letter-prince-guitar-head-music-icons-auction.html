Not because of me, not because of her, but because of the industry.”</p><p>Nevertheless, he sees nothing wrong with making a few bucks off two letters Spears wrote him while she was living in New York City — on the road to worldwide fame — and he was back home in Mississippi. “I wont say it’s free money, but it’s extra money,” he said.</p><p>The letters have a presale estimate of $4,000 to $6,000 each.</p><p>The<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> two-page break-up missive</a> — handwritten by Spears on lined notebook paper — begins, “Look, I’m really sorry that it had to be this way, but I think we both knew this was coming.</p><p>“I’ve been feeling this way for a long time now, but I was just scared of what would happen if I let you know,” it continues. “I know it’s really hard to have a girlfriend who travels, but it is even harder to have a boyfriend who doesn’t have trust in his girlfriend! You literally pushed me away. I couldn’t take it anymore! I’m not in love w/ you anymore, but will always care about you.”&nbsp;</p><p>Britney notes, “I’ve had a great two years,” and adds, “Who knows, two years from now or even 10, we might get back together if it’s meant to be.”</p><p>It wasn’t meant to be. Following the split, Spears dated fellow future pop star Timberlake.</p><p>A second letter up for auction — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">written in 1998</a> — isn’t as diplomatic.</p><p>“What was wrong with you at lunch? You were mean,” an upset Spears writes. “I don’t trust you, especially after what you said last night. My mom was almost right, you are like a caring friend, but f**ks me whenever you like.” Spears concludes the letter with:&nbsp;“You a**hole! [heart] Britney.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">The second Britney Spears letter up for auction.</figure><p>Spears sent the letter from her Upper East Side apartment to Jones’ post office box in McComb. The item comes with the original envelope postmarked Aug. 3, 1998.</p><p>“Not many people can say Britney Spears broke up with them and have the letter to prove it,” Julien’s Auctions CEO Darren Julien, told The Post. “This might be the only break-up letter she ever wrote as the others would have been done by text, email or a phone call making this even more rare/valuable.”</p><p>An email to Spears’ publicist was not immediately returned.</p><p>Also on the block are Bob Dylan’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">handwritten lyrics to his 1969 track “Lay Lady Lay,”</a> which carry the auction’s priciest presale estimate of $500,000 to $600,000, Julien said.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">A 1994 blue cloud electric guitar</a> commissioned by Prince could go for $80,000.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Prince’s 1994 blue cloud electric guitar.<span class=credit>Julien’s Auctions/ MEGA</span></figure><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Prince’s stage wardrobe<span class=credit>Julien’s Auctions/ MEGA</span></figure><p>A tangerine-orange jumpsuit worn onstage by Elton John with a $20,000 estimate and an Alex Van Halen drum kit, expected to fetch $300,000, are also among the hot lots.</p><p>The auction also features a large selection of memorabilia from Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and the Rolling Stones, paintings by Frank Sinatra, some of The Beatles’ Gold Records and more. The “Icon” items will be on display from June 7-11 prior to the auction, held online and live at Julien’s Beverly Hills galleries, from June 11-13.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Alex Van Halen’s historic 1980 Invasion tour Ludwig drum set.<span class=credit>Julien’s Auctions/ MEGA</span></figure><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkqe2tbrEsmSsqJWWv7R5waucmqNdqr1uuMStq56qXaW%2FqrrCnmSgrZmprrN5x56YnWWdqsCqr4yimqimo2Kutq%2FToqanZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./category-type-enhancing-held-items.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Category:Type-enhancing held items - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bethany-finlay.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bethany Finlay</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
