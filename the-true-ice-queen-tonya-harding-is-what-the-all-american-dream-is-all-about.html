It’s really a shame that most people remember her for that figure skating controversy rather than the amazing things she did on the ice.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>That sensationalized movie starring Margot Robbie didn’t help either. We’re not even going to get into that. <a href=#>Tonya Harding</a> was a natural on the ice. Despite the hardships she endured growing up, it didn’t deter her dream of becoming the best figure skater she can be. Watching <a href=#>Tonya Harding</a> perform was like a magical experience.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Her grace, beauty, and natural talent emanated with each performance. <a href=#>Tonya Harding</a>’s aura and charisma were definitely something else, and it’s hard to take your eyes off of her once she begins her set.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#>Tonya&nbsp;Harding</a> is a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion.</p><p>She made a name for herself in the ‘80s, taking the U.S. Figure Skating Championships by storm between 1986 and 1989. The proud Fan Arch athlete became a household name when she won the 1989 Skate America competition and went on to become the 1991 and 1994 U.S. champion. She even took home two silver medals in the <a href=#>Olympics</a>.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#>Tonya Harding</a> even became the first American woman and the second woman in history to successfully execute a triple&nbsp;Axel jump in competition. It’s one of figure skating’s most difficult tricks to perform.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>She topped that by also being the first woman to successfully execute two triple Axels in a single competition and the first ever to complete a triple Axel in combination with a double toe loop — which is another complicated ice skating move.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>But despite her accomplishments, she still faced criticism. Doubters questioned her wardrobe, her hair, and even the way she talked. Misogyny in women’s sports is nothing new, but <a href=#>Tonya Harding</a> rose through it all.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Do you want to follow the American dream like the great <a href=#>Tonya Harding</a>?

She traded the ice skating rink for a boxing ring.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#>Tonya Harding</a> initially boxed for a Fox Network Celebrity Boxing event before eventually turning pro. The ice skater turned boxer competed six times, and went 3-3. Unfortunately, her boxing career was cut short by asthma.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#>Tonya Harding</a> also made TV appearances on Dancing With the Stars and Worst Cooks in America, among other commitments. <a href=#>Tonya Harding</a> made mistakes. Who doesn’t, right? But it shouldn’t take away the magnificent accomplishments she had as a figure skater.<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><a href=#>Tonya Harding</a>&nbsp;and 700+ professional athletes and influencers have personalized merchandise on the Fan Arch’s website!</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0150/0758/0260/files/Tonya-Harding_480x480.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Fan Arch aims to transcend the narrative by making it easier to bridge the gap between athletes, influencers, and their fans.
