If the guy doesn’t have a good personality, then the physical connection will get old REALLY quickly!”</p><p>The <a href=#>Revenge Looks Better Naked author</a>, who has been linked to athletes <a href=#><strong>Matt Kemp</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>James Harden</strong></a>, noted that someone who can make her laugh is key to a successful partnership.</p><p>“I like a man with a sense of humor. I’m really silly and goofy, so I need someone who can appreciate that and serve it back to me,” Kardashian wrote. “But I don’t want him to be too out-there and so quirky that we don’t share the same kind of jokes, LOL.”</p><p>The former <a href=#>Revenge Body host</a>, however, pointed to “drive and determination” as the “sexiest” qualities in a suitor. “I want someone who has structure to his days – he doesn’t necessarily have to be on my schedule, but if he’s working towards a goal and is driven, it’s a turn-on,” she explained.</p><p>Throughout her 20 seasons on KUWTK, the reality star shared her relationship highs and lows with fans, including <a href=#>her divorce from Odom</a>, which was finalized in 2016, and <a href=#>multiple cheating scandals</a> involving Thompson.</p><p>The constant limelight on her private life eventually took a toll, according to Kardashian who opened up about the <a href=#>negatives of being so open on TV</a>.</p><p>“Sometimes <a href=#><strong>Kim [Kardashian]</strong></a> and I have had this conversation really openly, is that we feel like we give so much and maybe others aren’t holding up their end of the deal too,” she told <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong></a> in June 2021 during the family’s Keeping Up With the Kardashians reunion special. “If other people are going through things and are choosing not to share, that’s when it’s unfair, but if there’s really nothing else going on in someone’s life, what are they supposed to share?”</p><p>During part two of the reunion, the TV personality <a href=#>got real about her life with then-boyfriend Thompson</a>, who had cheated on her in 2018 and 2019 before the two took a break. They later rekindled their romance in August 2020, before <a href=#>calling it quits once more in June 2021</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You know Tristan and I definitely are not perfect,” she explained at the time. “But it’s also like <a href=#><strong>Kourtney [Kardashian]</strong></a> said, I get when you open up your personal life to so many people too, you hear so much outside noise as well.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive Khloé’s most memorable relationships over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksrex0bJkq5mgpbKzecCnm2aZpJ25psDEZqKhpJ%2Baeqyt0Z2YrKCZlrtutMCsZJ2ZpJqxbsOTbWdraWZk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dj-khaled-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kids, DJ Khaled Wife Ethnicity, Age, Net Worth And All You Need To Learn</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./katy-texas-community-devastated-by-the-loss-of-14-year-old-boy-died-in-a-car-crash.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Katy, Texas Community Devastated by The Loss of 14-Year Old Boy; Died in A Car Crash</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
