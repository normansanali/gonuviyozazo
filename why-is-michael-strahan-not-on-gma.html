In the years since, he became a staple on the popular morning series. But he has also taken a few significant breaks from the show.</p><p>So, why is Michael Strahan not on Good Morning America lately? Here's what we know so far about the situation.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Michael Strahan not on 'GMA'?</h2><p>Michael's most recent absence from GMA (his last appearance was Oct. 26, 2023) — as well as his recent absence from his football commentating gig on <a href=#>Fox NFL Sunday</a> (he last appeared on Oct. 22, 2023) — have been due to a family issue.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Michael Strahan will not be with us this week as he is dealing with some personal family matters,” an ABC spokesperson told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a> in its Nov. 6, 2023 report. “We appreciate everyone’s thoughts and concerns.”</p><p>And during the Nov. 5, 2023 broadcast of Fox NFL Sunday, commentator Curt Menefee told the audience that Michael was “dealing with a personal family matter."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In the past, Michael's absences have been typically explained by his many other projects, both on television and beyond. Indeed, Michael not only works on GMA and <a href=#>Fox NFL Sunday</a> (which film on opposite coasts), but he also hosts $The 100,000 Pyramid. The busy multihyphenate has own skincare line as well, in addition to a well-known apparel line.

Michael has a lot of irons in the fire, from his production company (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SMAC Entertainment</strong></a>) to his duties as an NFL announcer, but he seems to be a cracker jack at time management.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"People say, 'When do you sleep? Why do you work so much? You do Fox. You do GMA. You do The $100,000 Pyramid.' I love it though," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> back when his skincare line launched. "And I'm now at the point of where I don't have to do anything I don't enjoy. And if it gets to the point where I don't, then it'll be time to let that [thing] go. For now, every bit of it is fun."</p><p>We certainly hope that all is well for Michael and his family, and that he returns to our screens soon!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZKahk52upriMrKurmZiWu266zq1kqKZdnLqi</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-smiths-ex-girlfriend-was-a-major-reason-for-role-fresh-prince-of-bel-air.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Smith's Ex-Girlfriend Is A Major Reason For His Career-Changing Role In The Fresh Prince Of Bel</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sundance-film-festival-2017-movies-stereotypes-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Will Be the Sundance-iest Movie at Sundance Next Year?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
