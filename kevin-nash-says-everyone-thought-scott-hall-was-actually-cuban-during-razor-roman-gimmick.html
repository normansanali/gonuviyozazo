The Bad Guy was so convincing that it made people think he was Cuban, and one of his best friends agreed with the assumption.</p><p>Speaking on the&nbsp;<a href=#>KLIQ This</a> podcast, Kevin Nash spoke highly of Hall, praising his overall character. He put over Hall as one of the top five wrestlers of all time and think of him as the total package as a wrestler and it doesn’t matter if he was a heel or a babyface.</p><p>“Without a doubt, he’s probably one of the five most talented wrestlers. I’ll put him–to put Scott Hall on your Mount Rushmore is not because you lost your friend. I’ve touched with everybody, all the Hall of Fame guys, and there’s nobody better than Scott Hall. Nobody. Scott can wrestle, Scott can punch and kick. Scott can work babyface, Scott can work heel. He’s a great tag wrestler. He was the total package.”</p><p>Nash went on to speak about Hall’s presentation of the Razor Ramon gimmick in WWE/F. He even mentioned that Diamond Dallas Page was the inspiration for him using the toothpick during his time in both companies.</p><p>“I think towards the end [of his WWF run], I think he was less Razor Ramon and more Scott Hall. But the thing was, was that he was so convincing that every time we go someplace, people would, anybody of Latin or Spanish descent, they would always speak Spanish to Scott. Everybody thought he was Cuban, like [Scott would say] ‘no dude I’m from Baltimore’.</p><p>“Dallas — him and [DDP] were going to bring the toothpicks out, but Dallas fumblef*cked his before [it happened]. So it ended up Scott being the only one that threw the toothpick. But Dallas gave him the whole look, Dallas told him [how to dress].”</p><p>Sadly Hall passed away earlier this year at the age of 63. In 2020, he was inducted alongside Nash, Sean Waltman, and Hulk Hogan as the New World Order into the WWE Hall of Fame for a second time.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
