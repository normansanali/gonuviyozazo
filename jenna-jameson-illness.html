When her problems first appeared Jameson said:</p><p>“It started very suddenly, I was doing very well and then I just started collapsing and lost my ability to walk … they admitted me into the hospital. I think I spent about nine months in the hospital.”</p><p>Jameson was also informed by the physicians that she had six months in a year to live. She confessed:</p><p>“When I was first told that I didn’t have very long to live, I think I just balled up, I didn’t really know how to digest that.”</p><p>After being in the hospital for months without receiving a definitive diagnosis or any relief from her problems, Jameson made the decision to leave. She told:</p><p>“I finally got to the point where I was like, I have to take my health into my own hands, so I put myself in a wheelchair and I wheeled myself out of the hospital. I ended up just taking everything into my own hands and making it happen. I knew that I still had so much life left to live.”</p><p>Jameson was resolved to follow a more holistic path after leaving the hospital, so she made significant changes to her life, including continuing to eat healthily. Jameson said:</p><p>“I was having a lot of memory issues and I lost years and years and years of my life, so I started going to a cognitive therapist that puts you through puzzles and all these things, and everything just started reconnecting. I feel myself coming back to life when I eat correctly, keto wise. I feel energetic.”</p><p>Despite the fact that Jameson’s holistic approach has greatly helped, according to her rep, she isn’t 100% better but feels more positive about her future now.</p><p>In May, Jameson wed podcast host Jessi Lawless. Jameson spent his first nearly two months in the hospital in early 2022. Even with a walker, Jameson was unable to walk during her unidentified sickness.</p><p><strong>If you want to get more information related to the health of other stars you can read our below posts:</strong></p><p>You can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow us on Twitter</a> and read our most recent posts to know more about illnesses affecting other celebrities, health updates, and other topics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZXxzfo6jnKemkWK3ornErKanZZmhua%2Bx0qxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kailyn-lowry-claps-back-at-troll-over-pregnancy-status.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kailyn Lowry Claps Back at Troll Over Pregnancy Status</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jai-nice-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jai Nice - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
