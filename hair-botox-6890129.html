The neurotoxin is famously known for reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, so when it's spoken about outside that context, it can raise some eyebrows.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, Botox has a slew of other health benefits too, such as reducing migraines and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>TMJ-related pain</a>. However, most recently, "hair Botox" has entered the conversation and thrown people off balance. Botox, for hair? What could that possibly mean and how could hair actually benefit from neurotoxin injections?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We had many questions about the treatment — starting with what it even is. So, we tapped a celebrity hairstylist knowledgeable in the topic and asked her to break down everything there is to know about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hair Botox.</a> From what the treatment entails, who it benefits, what the potential side effects are, and more, keep scrolling.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-hair-botox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Hair Botox?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While traditional Botox involves injecting a neurotoxin into the skin, hair Botox is something completely different. "A&nbsp;hair&nbsp;Botox&nbsp;is a deep conditioning treatment, typically protein based, to strengthen, smooth, and fill in damaged sites on&nbsp;hair&nbsp;to make&nbsp;hair&nbsp;appear healthier and shinier," shares Kevin Murphy's North America Style Master, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Lund</a>. Furthermore, she says the it's suitable for all hair types and textures.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-benefits-of-hair-botox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are the benefits of hair Botox?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Lund mentioned above, hair Botox is a reparative treatment with several hair health benefits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Because this treatment is protein-based, you can expect&nbsp;hair&nbsp;that is smoother with less frizz as well has a greater shine," she says. "In addition to being healthier and [more] moisturized, one of the biggest benefits is the added strength — your&nbsp;hair&nbsp;will be less prone to damage and breakage."&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-are-there-side-effects-of-getting-hair-botox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Are there side effects of getting hair Botox?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with most hair treatments, Lund says there aren't any serious side effects to worry about as long as you go to a qualified professional. (You wouldn't DIY a keratin treatment or dye your hair platinum at home, and you should follow the same principle with this as well.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You want to be sure that you are receiving a treatment with the best quality products as this will ensure that you are getting the most out of your treatment and that you are targeting your specific&nbsp;hair&nbsp;issues.," explains Lund. "This is a service that I do recommend from a professional, as hairdressers are trained to create a customized treatment plan specific to your&nbsp;hair&nbsp;needs."&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-know-if-you-should-get-hair-botox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to know if you should get hair Botox:</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lund says that if you struggle with dryness, breakage, frizz, or brittle&nbsp;hair, then it could benefit from a hair Botox treatment. "It is also a great way to be sure you maintain the health and integrity of your&nbsp;hair&nbsp;as seasons change," she adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, if you are going to spend the time and money on getting this treatment, she stresses the importance of proper maintenance. For the best and longest-lasting results, Lund recommends steering clear of shampoos with sulfates as they "can easily strip the benefits and using high quality products to support the treatment in between salon visits."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2WSpMGwxIxvb3JoYWeG</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-dye.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Dye</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-katrina-law-lose-weight-for-ncis.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Katrina Law Lose Weight for NCIS?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
