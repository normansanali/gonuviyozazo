He regularly appeared in their videos as well as the show “Viva La Bam”. All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Rake Yohn? As of mid-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $1 million, earned through success in his various activities. He was also part of the reality series “Jackass” which originally aired on MTV. They have produced several films as well, and as he continues his endeavors, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h3>Rake Yohn Net Worth $1 million</h3><p>Rake attended Penn State University and graduated with a degree in Chemistry, after which he started specializing in synthetic materials. He joined the CKY Crew and has been active since 1999.</p><p>Most of the crew consisted of skateboarders, and the group would release a series of videos called the “CKY video series” produced by Bam Margera – a total of four were released along with a documentary DVD. The videos and crew were named after the band CKY, which was started by <a href=#>Bam’s</a> brother Jess Margera. In the videos, Rake along with the crew performed various stunts and pranks, and also showed skating footage – the series would become successful, selling around 400,000 copies, so increasing Rake’s net worth. Rake became part of the cover of “CKY2K”, and “Volume 2”.</p><p>Afterwards, Yohn would continue to be involved with the crew, joining the reality series “Jackass” which aired from 2000 to 2002. They performed many dangerous stunts in the show, which proved to give acting careers to several CKY members. Three “Jackass” films have been released in partnership with Paramount Pictures. The show also paved the way for various spin-offs including “Viva La Bam” of which Yohn was a part. Yohn also started to get involved in the video game industry – he was put in the video game “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3” which was produced by Neversoft, and released for several consoles including the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, proving to be one of the highest rated PlayStation 2 games of all time.</p><p>In 2009, Rake continued his video game work, providing voice overs for the Xbox game “Trials HD” – the game was released through Xbox Live Arcade and involves players guiding a motorcycle through various obstacles with the use of video game physics. The game was well received, gaining high ratings. In 2012, Rake continued working with the franchise in “Trials Evolution” which was released for the PC and Xbox 360, and is a direct follow up of “Trials HD”.</p><p>For his personal life, no romantic associations have been even rumoured. It is known that Yohn complained that he didn’t earn any royalties for him being used in “Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3”. He also mentioned in an interview that he became friends with Bam through <a href=#>Brandon DiCamillo</a>. Bam would eventually invite him to film, and they’ve all been friends since.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.145788336933><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Rake Yohn</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 20, 1975</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>West Chester, Pennsylvania, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Chemist, Actor</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Pennsylvania State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Melissa Carr</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Art Webb</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Nicknames</td><td>Rakeyohn , The Rakeman Yohneth , Edward Carl Webb , Rake</td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/rakeyohn007</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1070120/</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>A Halfway House Christmas, Haggard: The Movie, Landspeed: CKY</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Blastazoid</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=3.5348837209302><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.8550724637681><td>1</td><td>Rake's face is pictured on the cover of <a href=#>CKY2K</a> (2000) and CKY Vol. 2.</td></tr><tr readability=1.3818181818182><td>2</td><td>Met <a href=#>Brandon DiCamillo</a> through his younger brother Art.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>He is known for his intense dislike of mustard.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Brother of <a href=#>Art Webb</a>.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>5</td><td>Attended Pennsylvania State University .</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Works as a chemist</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Borrowed Happiness</td><td>2014</td><td>Short</td><td>Foursome Guy</td></tr><tr><td>Minghags</td><td>2009</td><td></td><td>Yohan</td></tr><tr><td>Hotdog Casserole</td><td>2008</td><td></td><td>Lex Tanner</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>A Halfway House Christmas</td><td>2005</td><td></td><td>Killer (as Rake Yohn)</td></tr><tr><td>Haggard</td><td>2003</td><td></td><td>Hellboy (as Rake Yohn)</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Blastazoid</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series producer</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Thanks <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=thanks readability=2><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>The Making of 'Jackass: The Movie'</td><td>2002</td><td>TV Special short documentary very special thanks -
