And it’s not just what you think — how you deliver it, and the audience also matters impartially. TikTok Therapist Unusually Bree learned this the hard way as she faced backlash for warning men not to follow the guidance of male relationship experts like the late Kevin Samuels.</span></p><p><span>Keep reading this TikTok Therapist Unusually Bree Bio to learn more about her.</span></p><h3><b>Why Was TikTok Therapist Unusually Bree Fired From Her Job?</b></h3><p><span>TikTok Therapist Unusually Bree was fired from her job a few weeks after she posted the TikTok video where she shared an article from Psychology Today titled “The Rise of Lonely and Single Men”. In the video, the therapist explained how heterosexual men had less success dating women within the last few years due to women demanding more from relationships, and the article eloquently explained what she has warned men about in the past.</span></p><p><span>According to her, men who seek guidance from male relationship experts like the late Kevin Samuels will be “single” for the rest of their lives if they don’t improve their “communication” and “emotional intelligence skills.”</span></p><p><span>Naturally, the video went viral on TikTok with over 200,000 views, and it was also shared on Twitter by people who had their own social and political agendas. Soon, the hate comments started flooding it. But instead of redeeming herself, the therapist stood her ground and d continued making more videos supporting her take, even referring to men as “dusty bi**hes” in another viral TikTok.</span></p><p><span>A week after the initial video, Bree then released another video where she alleged that her video was used to launch a gender war and people perceived her comments to be directed only at Black men. And whilst also this was happening, several users all her job and demanded she gets fired from the employer, which ultimately happened.</span></p><p><span>So, after Bree lost her job, she apologized on her platform and shared her negative online experience on her page and other outlets. “I was harassed and received more death threats than I can count;&nbsp; my social media pages were even reported. Since posting that video, I have battled depressive episodes and had my life, safety, and well-being violated,” she explained.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, she finds it “imperative to reclaim my name and let people know that there is a real person behind my content.” She claimed that the only reason she was&nbsp; “punished online” was because of her delivery.</span></p><p><span>“It wasn’t what I said, and it was how I said it. But I was just being my true self, and if you follow me, you know that’s how I speak. My approach can be abrasive, but I’m just a direct speaker. However, nothing I said in that video was wrong,” she once again stood her ground.</span></p><h3><b>TikTok Therapist Unusually Bree Net Worth</b></h3><p><span>TikTok Therapist Unusually Bree garnered a net worth of under $250 thousand by 2023.</span></p><p><span>This popular therapist started her career in 2016, right after graduating from </span><i><span>Baldwin Wallace University </span></i><span>with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology degree (named to the&nbsp; Dean’s List).</span></p><p><span>Showcasing her degree on IG, Bree wrote, “The single most expensive piece of paper that I’ve ever purchased.” She then went on to recall her “stories, memories, and experiences” that were all crammed into this one sheet of paper. “From traveling the world to surviving all-nighters, it was all so worth it.
