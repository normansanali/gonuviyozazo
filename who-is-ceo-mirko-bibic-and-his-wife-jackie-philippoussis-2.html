If you are unaware of the background, you can read about Lisa’s firing, which we have already reported.</p><p>Since she was a long-term employee who spent decades in the company, speculations began to circulate that the removal might have been due to her growing age or other personal factors. However, against the talks, Mirko clarified that the decision to remove her was not due to her age, gender, or grey hair, in his Linkedin post.</p><p>This response has brought the CEO into the limelight, and here is everything you need to know about him.</p><h2 id=bell-ceo-mirko-bibic-wikipedia-who-is-he><span class=ez-toc-section id=bell-ceo-mirko-bibic-wikipedia-who-is-he></span> Bell CEO Mirko Bibic Wikipedia: Who Is He?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bell CEO, Mirko Bibic, is a Canadian corporate personality who has been working as the CEO of the Bell media company for over two years.</p><p>Although he doesn’t have a dedicated Wikipedia bio page, we can find other details about the man from various social media platforms. He was promoted to Chief Executive Officer of Bell in January 2020 and has worked diligently in that power since the climb.</p><p>Before that,&nbsp; Bibic served as the Chief Operating Officer at BCE Bell for one year and four months. His Linkedin bio further reveals that Mirko worked as EVP, Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer from March 2012 to October 2018, after serving as the Senior Vice President of Regulatory Affairs.</p><p>He joined Bell in 2004 and holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree from McGill University and a Law degree from the University of Toronto, as known from his BCE profile.</p><h2 id=what-is-bell-ceo-mirko-bibic-salary-in-2022><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-bell-ceo-mirko-bibic-salary-in-2022></span> What Is Bell CEO Mirko Bibic Salary In 2022?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bell CEO, Mirko Bibic, earns an annual salary of around $4.7 million, per Wallmine.</p><p>However, that is not the only money that he takes home in the form of compensation. According to Erieri, Bibic took home a massive amount of $9,477,299 in 2020, which included cash of $2,910,700 and equity of $6 million. On top of that, he also received $566,599 in pension and other forms of compensation.</p><p>Similarly, Wallmine further reports that Mirko is the second highest earner at Bell, with Wade Oosterman taking over $6.8 million annually. Based on these numbers, it is clear that Bibic has a great fortune under his control, probably worth multi-millions.</p><p>Nonetheless, the official verification is still pending.</p><h2 id=meet-mirko-bibic-wife-jackie-philippoussis><span class=ez-toc-section id=meet-mirko-bibic-wife-jackie-philippoussis></span> Meet Mirko Bibic Wife Jackie Philippoussis<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mirko Bibic has a loving wife in the form of Jackie Philippoussis, who he met during his teenage years.</p><p>Although there is little to nothing about Mirko’s wife and other personal details, several online sites mention that Bibic and his spouse, Philippoussis, are parents to three sons. The family currently lives together in Montreal after they moved from Ottawa.</p><p>Despite being a top personality, Mirko has a limited online presence and is unavailable on major social media sites. Thus, he likes to keep his family and other aspects private and has never opened up about them publicly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ycnKhlnZ6%2FrLuMm6CboZNirq%2BwjKGgrGWnnrOmecmamqShlWK9qbXLoqepp6WowKq%2FjGtm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-bridgertons-anthony-and-kate-are-missing-from-most-of-season-3.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Bridgerton's Anthony and Kate Are Missing From Most of Season 3</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-is-the-bachelor-contestant-lea-cayanan-from-and-where-does-she-currently-reside.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where is The Bachelor contestant Lea Cayanan from and where does she currently reside?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
