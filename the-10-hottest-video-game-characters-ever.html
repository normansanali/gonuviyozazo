Whether it’s the thrill of hours-long bingeing, undertaking side missions, exploring open-world landscapes, meeting new characters, achieving 100% completion, or simply having fun, there’s something for everyone in the vastness of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video game</a></strong> appeal. But even when you’re fully engrossed in a game, there are characters who can be terribly distracting when trying to focus on the task at hand.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>We’re convinced that developers purposefully make certain characters notoriously and ridiculously attractive so as to rack up our play time. Every gamer is guilty of checking out an NPC or switching camera angles to take a closer look at the protagonist’s “assets,” so there’s nothing to be ashamed of. But whether you’re straight, gay, bisexual, pansexual, or any other identity under the LGBTQIA+ umbrella, there’s certain to be a video game character you’ve caught yourself swooning over.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=204 data-injectable=false>There’s no shortage of attractive individuals in games, be it male or female or neither — or both! With a surplus of hunky men and ethereal women, who wouldn’t be drooling over those pixels?</p><h2 id=h-lara-croft-tomb-raider-series data-injectable=false>Lara Croft (Tomb Raider series)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=700 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>She’s been around since 1996’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a></strong>, and evolved through unspeakable phases such as the “triangular bosom” and the “ridiculously thin waist,” but nowadays she’s much more proportionate. Gone are the days of the cursed Lara Croft, but she’s remained a femme fatale through the handcrafted animation that hasn’t always flattered her. She’s aged like fine wine, even if a lot of that credit is owed to Square Enix for reimagining her entire design in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2013 remake</a> onward without the technological limitations of the ’90s. Croft has been one of the leading sex symbols in video games for longer than some of us have been alive.</p><h2 id=h-lady-dimitrescu-resident-evil-village data-injectable=false>Lady Dimitrescu (Resident Evil Village)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=777 data-current-count=1077 data-injectable=true>Fondly referred to as “Lady D,” the ruler of Castle Dimitrescu, Alcina was one of the Four Lords of the region before her death by Ethan Winter’s hand in 2021 after conspiring with Mother Miranda to abduct his daughter Rose. When Resident Evil Village released in May 2021, there was an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">immediate buzz surrounding Lady D</a>, whom Capcom seemed to purposefully endow with certain appealing advantages. It took the concept of attractive villainy to a whole other level, introducing <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RE</a></strong> fans to a 9-foot-tall, dark-haired mistress with a god complex and an insane bloodlust. Apparently, that’s precisely the combination that the internet finds inviting, since Lady D’s unveil prompted the whole community to collectively and excessively thirst over her.</p><h2 id=h-yennefer-of-vengerberg-the-witcher-iii-wild-hunt data-injectable=false>Yennefer of Vengerberg (The Witcher III: Wild Hunt)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=863 data-current-count=1163 data-injectable=true>We’d argue that Yennefer is potentially the most conventionally attractive female in gaming history. Geralt’s truest love, Yennefer was a sorceress who acted as a mother figure to Ciri. Maybe it’s the all-black attire or the flowing locks to match, but something about Yennefer is downright irresistible. It’s often said that a woman’s attractiveness doesn’t necessarily lie within her physical appearance but more her intelligence and morality. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In The Witcher III</a>, Yennefer is undoubtedly the whole package; she’s beautiful, ingenious, and just the right amount of mysterious. Many men have attempted to tame her and none but Geralt have succeeded. <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher III: Wild Hunt</a></strong> has a muscular male lead with an equally enticing female on his arm, so it was tempting to include all the characters of the video game series.</p><h2 id=h-joel-miller-the-last-of-us data-injectable=false>Joel Miller (The Last of Us)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E3V_3rhqw8</figure><p data-characters=378 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>As if we weren’t already in love with Joel Miller, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pedro Pascal’s portrayal</a> in HBO’s <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a></strong> series has increased our infatuation tenfold. Portrayed by Troy Baker in the Naughty Dog franchise, Joel is a hardened smuggler tasked with escorting Ellie — an immune teenager — across a post-apocalyptic America ravaged by the cordyceps fungal infection.</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>Considering that Joel becomes somewhat of a surrogate father to Ellie as the game progresses, he’s earned himself the title of ‘Daddy’ in more ways than one (absolute filth, isn’t it?). Maybe it’s the rugged good looks or the no-nonsense attitude, but whatever it is, Joel has earned himself a plethora of dedicated fans who would gladly kill Infected by his side. We’re assuming that it’s the mixture of the Texas accent, the full beard, and the deep, deep voice that sealed the deal for many Joel appreciators out there.</p><h2 id=h-chris-redfield-resident-evil-5 data-injectable=false>Chris Redfield (Resident Evil 5)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>Don’t be surprised to see multiple Resident Evil characters on this list. Capcom knew what they were doing. Another franchise, like The Witcher, that caters to the wider spectrum of sexualities with all manner of good-looking people. In almost every Resident Evil title, you can guarantee two things; an attractive male and an attractive female. Even in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">disastrous Resident Evil reboot</a>.</p><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>Sometimes, if we’re lucky, Capcom will even throw in an alluring villain, which makes all of us question ourselves. If it isn’t the Wesker siblings Albert and Alex, it’s Lady D and Heisenberg. If the Weskers can do it, so can the Redfields, and we were blessed with both Chris and Claire, though we see the former more often in other stories, such as when he appeared in Resident Evil Village. Chris’ bulging biceps could split trees, we’re convinced, but it’s the chiseled jawline and patchy beard that really changes the game. Can more men aspire to look like Chris Redfield?</p><h2 id=h-dante-devil-may-cry data-injectable=false>Dante (Devil May Cry)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>Characters like Joel Miller and Chris Redfield aren’t too dissimilar, so it’s a breath of fresh air to include <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Devil May Cry</a></strong>‘s Dante, who isn’t the stereotypical heartthrob. In fact, Dante has a much leaner build than some others, even if he does have noticeable abs. He’s either clean-shaven or sporting a bit of stubble and he doesn’t fit the ‘tall, dark and handsome’ description that many ladies in waiting would be expecting.</p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Still, he stands apart from the crowd and embraces his individuality, which is definitely intriguing. Above all else, Dante’s fashion sense is impeccable, so there’s his most valuable asset when attracting a mate. There’s nothing more tempting than Dante’s red leather jacket draped over his broad shoulders in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game of the series</a>. Are we painting a clear enough picture?</p><h2 id=h-john-marston-red-dead-redemption-ii data-injectable=false>John Marston (Red Dead Redemption/II)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLn-GFVbFW0</figure><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>Admittedly, this was a tossup between Arthur Morgan and John Marston, but we ultimately chose the latter. That isn’t to say that Arthur wasn’t a close contender, but we’ve gotten to know John Marston across two games in <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption</a></strong> and its sequel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption II </a>and he’s another one that’s aged marvelously.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>We see a younger Marston in RDR2 and his shenanigans with Dutch’s gang, then we see him progress to full-blown outlaw in RDR after the gang disbanded and Arthur died. He’s the kind of rough and ready gentleman who knows how to handle himself in a fight and yet still treats his wife Abigail with the utmost care and respect. There’s more to John Marston than just a pretty face; he’s the kind of man you’d bring home to your parents.</p><h2 id=h-solid-snake-metal-gear-solid data-injectable=false>Solid Snake (Metal Gear Solid)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=728 data-injectable=true>Just like Yennefer is the conventionally attractive female, Solid Snake is the male equivalent. He has dark hair, a goatee, a muscular build, and even a cool eye patch to boot. Throughout the majority of Metal Gear Solid, Solid Snake exhibits a calm, collected demeanor that makes him seem standoffish and arrogant. Apparently, that’s all it takes to win over a fanbase since Solid Snake became an immediate fan favorite.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>During the MGS series and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hopeful upcoming film</a>, Snake was often flirtatious towards his female companions, so gamers experienced Snake’s charm first-hand. Despite this, Snake was a loner by nature, so maybe it was the brooding disposition that made fans crazy for him? If we compare him to Batman, who also exhibited the same off-hand, brooding behavior, it isn’t hard to see why he turned so many heads. After all, Bruce Wayne is a catch too.</p><h2 id=h-poison-ivy-batman-arkham-series data-injectable=false>Poison Ivy (Batman Arkham series)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=789 data-current-count=1089 data-injectable=true>Aside from the, ahem… obvious <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reasons as to why Poison Ivy</a> earned herself a spot on this list, she’s also a formidable member of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman</a></strong>‘s Rogue’s Gallery. She’s voluptuous, sassy, seductive, and an all-round strong, independent woman. Although her pheromones are enough to seduce even men with the steeliest resolves, Ivy is often capable of seducing her enemies by mere personality alone. She’s confident in her sexual allure, so that’s often all she needs to entice men (and even some women) into doing her bidding. Poison Ivy was obviously created to appeal to the male gaze, so that explains the distinct lack of clothing in almost every single appearance besides perhaps HBO’s Harley Quinn series. But we’re not complaining…</p><h2 id=h-ada-wong-resident-evil-series data-injectable=false>Ada Wong (Resident Evil series)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>And that rounds out our Resident Evil trio, who are undeniably the most attractive characters to feature in the RE universe thus far. It’s long been believed (and proven) that Asian women have untouchable, ethereal beauty; their flawless complexions and petite bodies are all the evidence one needs of that. Capcom only added fuel to the fire by purposely choosing to dress Ada in a form-fitting outfit that shows off her long legs.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>It’s all subjective on a person-to-person basis, but generally speaking, those are the boxes one ticks when aspiring to be desirable. Sally Cahill, the voice of Ada Wong, also characterized the anti-hero with a soft, sultry voice reminiscent of Poison Ivy’s, so it’s no wonder that she’s a modern-day sex symbol of almost Lara Croft status.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Geralt of Rivia (The Witcher series)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=650 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>In the universe of The Witcher, there is something for everyone. While Yennefer of Vengerberg is the obvious choice for alluring characters, we can’t leave out the titular character himself. The even-tempered White Wolf is often found in various states of undress as he takes part in his simple pleasure of bathing, but that isn’t his most attractive quality. The entirety of The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt depicts Geralt’s determination to find his surrogate daughter, Ciri. After training her in the ways of hand-to-hand combat to the best of his ability, Ciri goes missing, and it is up to Geralt to make sure the Wild Hunt doesn’t kill her.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Geralt is a father first, caring more about her than her biological dad, Emhyr, does. The witcher goes on his romances as well, making players choose between arguably his soulmate, Yennefer and everyone’s favorite cinnamon roll, Triss. Through it all, Geralt has a devoted heart, and his skills with a sword aren’t too shabby either.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Kassandra (Assassin’s Creed Odyssey)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>In recent years, Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed games have perfected the art of sending players to ancient and distant lands. Unlike the Ezio trilogy, games like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Odyssey</a> lean less into the overarching drama of modern corporations and instead allow the viewer to lounge in ancient Greece. Playing as the misthios, Kassandra, you are thrown into a world of cults, intrigue, and missing family members. Through her eyes, you can see the debauchery of Ancient Greece, violence, and — of course — romance.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>When you’re not spending your time training to inevitably take down the cult that is ruining your life, you can appreciate all the spectacle and seduction that Ancient Greece has to offer. Kassandra can take you to decadent parties as well as romance any gender. Kassandra’s mercenary style and love for the simple pleasures in life make her a beautiful entry into a time gone by.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Johnny Silverhand (Cyberpunk)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=684 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>When playing Cyberpunk 2077, there are only two words you need to worry about: Keanu Reeves. That in itself should describe what is so attractive about Johnny Silverhands. Reeves did the motion capture for the character, adding his trademark Reeves-isms to the property. Even if he isn’t bringing about thoughts of The Matrix and John Wick, Johnny is alluring in his own right.</p><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=true>His charisma is one of his defining traits, which makes him all the more dangerous. After obtaining the cybernetic implant that gave him his nickname, Johnny became unstable – suffering from cyberpsychosis, which carried him until he died in 2023. Even after that, however, he remains a presence <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in the problematic game</a> due to his consciousness being held in an engram. Even when he’s physically out, he is always present to be one of the more ethically nuanced presences in the game.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Nathan Drake (Uncharted series)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>Laughing in the face of danger may not be one of the most sane qualities, but it is typically how Nathan Drake deals with adversaries in the games as well as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">formulaic Uncharted film</a>. The professional treasure hunter lives and dies by his preferred pastime, and that often involves getting into hairy situations. Nathan uses his dry humor and wit as a coping mechanism, making his fearless attitude even more admirable.</p><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=448 data-injectable=true>You can’t be a prolific treasure hunter without smarts, and Nathan has it in spades. The Uncharted character often uses his intelligence in life-and-death situations, and even though he gets into them frequently, you could do worse than having Nathan Drake on your side. Extremely loyal to friends and family, all these traits combined with his physical prowess when hunting down treasure make him an intriguing protagonist to watch. And play as.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Lilith (Borderlands)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=804 data-current-count=1104 data-injectable=true>One of the original playable characters in the Borderlands series, Lilith sets herself apart by her abilities – which vary from those of her cohorts. Though she is well practiced with firearms, she is also a rare class of Siren. She can use her supernatural abilities to Phasewalk, which she uses to become invisible and move quickly away from enemy targets. Her powers, confidence with guns, and general attitude make her an outlier in the Borderlands crew.&nbsp;</p><p>Quick to laugh at enemies she has taken down and rarely alarmed, all these qualities come together to form an impressive character that should get her due in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">live-action adaptation when it finally gets released</a>. Though she is mainly solitary in the first Borderlands game, her character is expanded upon in the later installments.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Galen Marek (Star Wars: The Force Unleashed)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=898 data-current-count=1198 data-injectable=true>As one of the prominent playable Sith characters in the Star Wars games, Galen Marek’s allure speaks for itself. Voiced by Star Wars expert Sam Witwer, Marek was born on Kashyyk before Vader killed his parents and took him on as his secret apprentice known as Starkiller. As with most Sith, Starkiller has a prowess with the Force that makes him particularly desirable. He is one of a kind as the rare Dark Side user that players can experience in The Force Unleashed.</p><p>Even better is Starkiller’s journey back to the side of light. After Vader betrays him, Starkiller teams up with Bail Organa and Mon Mothma to aid the rebels. This act is his last stand as he sacrifices himself to allow the rebel alliance to escape. His deft use of his Force powers and his moral quandaries make him one of the most attractive Star Wars characters that could have a resurgence in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 3rd game</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Garrus (Mass Effect)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>Though Garrus is an alien species in Mass Effect, that doesn’t diminish his overwhelmingly positive qualities. A popular choice for Shepard to romance in the games, he has many traits that make him an attractive character and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">would make for a great movie</a>. The Turian has a voice that many players admire, and this makes his personality that much more alluring.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Generally a calm and collected character, he proves his loyalty to Shepard throughout the gameplay. He sticks to his ideals and becomes more vulnerable the more Shepard interacts with him. These are the qualities that anyone would want in a partner whether they are an alien or not.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Black Cat (Spider-Man)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>One of the most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">underutilized characters in the live-action Spider-Man films</a>, fans can get the full Black Cat experience when playing the Spider-Man Sony game. The antithesis to what Peter Parker is about, Black Cat relishes in the darker side of life, though she never commits to one side. Peter encounters Black Cat as she enacts her thievery, highlighted by her black tactical suit. Though Mary Jane is Peter’s main romance in the games, there is no harm in looking at the thief when they are on the outs.</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>Her flexible morals make her a more interesting choice than Mary Jane, and she forces Peter to consider options. Her flirtatious nature and confidence make you wonder if Spider-Man should end up with his redheaded girlfriend.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>Merrin (Jedi Fallen Order series)</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=525 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>As Cal Kestis’ romance option in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jedi Fallen Order</a>, it may be easy to fall for Merrin. But she also has attributes that are alluring outside of the Jedi’s gaze. Cal first encounters her when on her home planet of Dathomir. She is the last remaining bastion of the fallen Nightsisters, who met their grisly end at the hands of General Grievous. Using powers similar to that of Jedi, the Nightsisters are often referred to as witches. At first, Merrin is distrustful of Cal’s intentions, but the attraction between the two becomes palpable.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>With pale skin and grey face tattoos, Merrin doesn’t look much like anyone else, which is what makes her so special. That and her control over magic makes her independent of Cal.
