USA, to Corinne, the founder and director of Virginia’s Montessori School and of Belgian descent, and Dirgham Salahi, a winery owner of Palestinian descent. He is a former winery owner and vintner, television personality, but perhaps best known for appearing in the reality television show “The Real Housewives of D.C.”.</p><p>So just how loaded is Tareq Salahi? Sources state that Salahi has acquired a net worth of over $2 million, as of early 2017, accumulated through his involvement in the entertainment industry and through his various business ventures.</p><h3>Tareq Salahi Net Worth $2 million</h3><p>Salahi grew up in Farquier County, Virginia. He attended the Randolph-Macon Academy in Front Royal, Virginia, and later enrolled at the University of California in Davis, obtaining his BA in oenology and business management in 1991.</p><p>Tareq then returned to Virginia to help run the family business, the Oasis Winery, started by his parents in the ’70s on their estate farm in Hume, Virginia as one of the first five wineries in the state. Their venture eventually evolved into a very lucrative business, with annual revenues reaching $1 million. Being involved in such a successful business brought Salahi a decent salary. He became managing director in 1994, getting a 5% minority interest in the vineyard, which greatly contributed to his wealth.</p><p>Meanwhile, he started another venture, the company called Oasis Enterprises, created to raise ancillary income as a venue for polo events and several other functions. It operated a limousine and an events-and-catering business, as well as wine country tours, considerably improving Salahi’s net worth.</p><p>However, his new business eventually created a conflict within his family. Reportedly, the winery began losing profits, and the family alleged that its assets were misdirected to Oasis Enterprises. They also accused Salahi of claiming to be the president of the winery. Salahi, on the other hands, made counter allegations against his family. The lawsuits were later dropped without resolution, but both companies eventually filed for bankruptcy. The assets of the Oasis Winery were sold at auction by 2013. However, Salahi later bought back all the assets and restarted the business.</p><p>Meanwhile in 2009 he and his then wife Michaele made headlines, attending a White House state dinner for Indian Prime Minister <a href=#>Manmohan Singh</a>, without invitation. Although the couple claimed they were invited, the Secret Service claimed the opposite; the incident involved legal inquiries, but also huge publicity for Salahi, especially as the couple’s entrance into the White House was filmed by the Bravo reality television show “The Real Housewives of D.C.”, as they were part of the show’s cast at the time.</p><p>In addition, Salahi has appeared in the CW Network’s “Where the Elite Meet” and several other shows. His television involvement has been another source of hisnet worth.</p><p>In 2012 Salahi decided to run for Governor of Virginia in the 2013 election, initially as a Republican but later switching to run as an independent, and then turning it into a write-in campaign. In late 2013 he announced that he was running as a Republican for Virginia’s 10th congressional district in the 2014 elections, later transitioning to the Independent Greens; he didn’t make it to the ballot.</p><p>Tareq has also been involved in polo, captaining the US polo team during the ’90s and founding the America’s Polo Cup event in 2007.<br>Salahi currently runs several business, including Hotels at Sea, a cruise ship charter for various events. He is also involved in the companies Connoisseur Traveler and Blue Ridge Wine Way, and rents out his home on Airbnb, apparently all earning him contributions to his net worth.</p><p>In his private life, Salahi married Michaele Holt in 2003, but they divorced in 2012, after Michaele became involved with the Journey guitarist <a href=#>Neal Schon</a>. As of 2016, he has been married to Lisa Spolden.</p><p>Salahi has been involved in philanthropy, however, including in several fundraising events and organizations, but his charity work has attracted controversy, due to alleged dubious financial arrangements.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=4.7680608365019><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tareq Salahi</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 26, 1969</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Washington, D.C., United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Vintner</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of California, Davis</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Michaele Salahi (m. 2003–2012)</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3723967/</a></td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=4><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>Crashed Jerry Jones's suite at the Super Bowl [February 8, 2011].</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>His attorney is Lisa Bloom.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>3</td><td>White House party crasher on November 24, 2009.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Late Show with David Letterman</td><td>2010</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Tareq Salahi</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=8><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Lord of the Freaks</td><td>2015</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>Southern Fried Homicide</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>America's Book of Secrets</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series documentary</td><td>Himself -
