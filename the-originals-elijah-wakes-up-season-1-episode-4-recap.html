Oh, did I forget to add that Klaus told Cami all about vampires, but compelled her not to be too freaked out? A&nbsp;lot&nbsp;happened this week.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>During Davina’s outing, we met Tim (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shane Coffey</strong></a>), a boy she was friends with before she was forced into hiding. But more importantly,&nbsp;Klaus&nbsp;met Tim, and proceeded to push him off the church balcony to his near-death. As Davina sobbed over Tim’s body, Klaus offered to heal him in exchange for a favor, knowing full well Davina was desperate enough to agree to any demand.</p><h3>Welcome Back, Brother</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>But Tim wasn’t the&nbsp;only&nbsp;member of the male persuasion Davina encountered this week. At the end of the episode, she spoke with none other than Elijah (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Daniel Gillies</strong></a>), who awoke when Davina temporarily pulled out his dagger. Not knowing that the initial pull was enough to wake him up, she stabbed him again, and was surprised when he eventually addressed her — standing upright.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>He also communicated with Rebekah (<strong>Claire Holt</strong>), via flashback, assuring her that he’s going to be all right.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Finally, some&nbsp;good&nbsp;news!</p><h3>Cami’s Skeletons</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>It turns out Cami is more than just a pretty blonde with above-average bar-tending skills; she’s got serious issues! Years ago, when he twin brother was in seminary school, he killed himself and several other student — a massacre that’s still discussed in New Orleans to this very day.&nbsp;But Cami doesn’t believe her brother chose to hurt anyone. She believes he was&nbsp;made&nbsp;to do it, and as we learned in her final scene, that’s the whole reason she came to New Orleans in the first place!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Speaking of Cami’s final scene, can we talk about the crazy chemistry between her and Klaus?! I couldn’t believe that Klaus — the same immortal bastard who staked Aunt Jenna without hesitation on the second season of&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries&nbsp;— was actually caring about a human being. And don’t even get me started on the way his eyes welled up with tears; it was all too much to handle.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The Originals&nbsp;is really bringing out Klaus’ human side, and I like it!</p><h3>Bye, Bayou</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10>Meanwhile, Hayley learned that not all witches can be trusted. In fact, some of them are shady as hell.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Like Agnes, who told Hayley she was taking her to some kind of crazy swamp doctor — red flag, anyone? — for a check-up. Cut to Hayley stabbing Dr. Crazy in the neck with a hypodermic needle, then narrowly escaping out the window, as she’s pursued by an angry mob of (I assume) witches. Agnes totally sold her out. She sucks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Hayley faced a rough trek through those woods, even with a concerned Rebekah suddenly by her side, until they both eventually fell prey to the hunters’ arrows. So why, then, did both girls also emerge unharmed once the ordeal was over? Why, it was because of Hayley’s mysterious wolf pal, again!</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>I’m sure it goes against all laws of nature and&nbsp;<strong>Julie Plec</strong>, but I would flip out if that wolf somehow turned out to be Tyler from&nbsp;The Vampire Diaries. Can you imagine getting that surprise crossover?! Besides, why else would he be staying away from Mystic Falls for so long?</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>It’s like the great philosopher&nbsp;<strong>Ellie Goulding&nbsp;</strong>once proclaimed: “Anything can happen!”</p><h3>WATCH: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Danielle Campbell Talks Witchcraft On ‘The Originals’</a></h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think there might be something between Klaus and Cami that they’re not aware of?
