Their mother-daughter relationship has also made headline news but not for the reason you may think. In recent years, Richards has been accused of fostering an unhealthy relationship with Sami. Not only have the public criticized their relationship but so has the media and her ex-husband Charlie Sheen.

And while most parents are free to discipline their children behind closed doors, celebrities' actions are often brought to light and opened up to public scrutiny and sometimes condemnation.</p><p>Richards' relationship with her eldest daughter, Sami Sheen, has long been troubled. Their frayed relationship began to play out before the cameras when Denise Richards joined the cast of the hit Bravo reality TV series The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-8.jpg><p>Fans couldn't get enough of Richard's storyline on the reality show as the actress has long been known for her explosive relationship with ex-husband Charlie Sheen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Denise-Richards-Featured-Image.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Is Eloise Joni Richards Close With Denise’s Other Children?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Denise Richards has a few children, but Eloise is the only one with special needs.</span><p>In the show, Richards shared a life with her current husband, healing center owner Aaron Phypers, and her three daughters, Sami, Lola Rose, and Eloise Joni.</p><p>Despite their luxurious lifestyle, things between Denise and her <a href=#>daughters seemed less than idyllic</a>. The cracks in their family dynamic were revealed after the Blonde and Blonder actress admitted on the reality show that she was having difficulty raising her kids, particularly Sami, who Richards said seemed determined to defy her rules.</p><p>Not long after Denise Richards' shocking admission on TV, her daughter Sami took to social media to reveal her side of the story regarding her relationship with her mother.</p><p>In a video she uploaded to TikTok, Sami added that the home she shared with Richards had become abusive. As a result, Sami claimed she had grown to have self-confidence issues. The troubled teen went further and added that during her time with her mother, step-father, and sisters, there were days she would go without eating or sleeping.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/sami-sheen-3.png><p>Sami also said that the toxic environment negatively affected her mental health, to the point that she dreaded going to school. The teen then revealed that she had moved out of her mother's house and was living with her father, where she claimed she was happy and doing things on her terms.</p><p>Not long after Sami moved in with her biological father, who told the media that he loved his daughter and chose to raise her entirely differently than Richards had, the latter defended how she raised her children.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In an article by PageSix</a>, Richards explained on the Jeff Lewis Has An Issue podcast that it was hard for any parent to raise children, particularly in a superficial environment like Los Angeles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Denise Richards then implied that her daughter was spoiled and that though she had tried to raise all her children right, her eldest had resisted.

I love you".</p><p>Although many deemed Sami's actions inappropriate for her age, what outraged them more was that her mother, Denise Richards, had supported her daughter opening up an account on the salacious website. Charlie Sheen also opposed his<a href=#> daughter's actions and even criticized Richards</a> for encouraging her to make money on OnlyFans.</p><p>Not long after her daughter went on OnlyFans, Richards opened up an account on the platform, leaving many creeped out by this strange mother-daughter bonding activity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-17t193003-359.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Are Praising Charlie Sheen's Two And A Half Men Girlfriend Jennifer Taylor For Her Ageless Look In A Recent Cameo</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Jennifer Taylor had fans talking during a recent Cameo, discussing her time on Two and a Half Men.</span><p>But what further enraged the public was when Denise Richards hinted that she was planning to collaborate with her daughter on the platform.</p><p>According to Stuff Entertainment magazine, several Reddit users went online to express their disgust of Richards' actions, with one person saying," Creepy creepy creepy.
