Madonna has always been the absolute image of strength, and it's not often she's openly vulnerable, but she wanted to honor her mother, and she did so beautifully.</p><p>"I stood on stage for 81 shows staring up at the beautiful face of my mother and wondering what she must’ve been thinking as she waved goodbye to me from her hospital window," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote on her Instagram</a>. "I stepped into the station wagon and shut the door not knowing it was the last time I’d see her."</p><p>Madonna was only five when her mother died, so no one thought to explain to her that she was sick, which caused her sleep-related trauma she still battles with. "<strong>Nobody told me my mother was dying</strong> - I just watched her disintegrate mysteriously and then she disappeared and there was no explanation except that she had gone to sleep," she shared, "<strong>which explains my tumultuous relationship with sleep</strong>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she was obviously hurting as she wrote the emotional post remembering her mother, she was also happy to be around her supportive family. "<strong>Tonight all of my children sleep under one roof which is rare and comforting</strong>," she added. "They grow up too fast and spin out in different directions. And yes I have a hard time letting go."</p><h2 id=madonna-on-being-a-mother-after-growing-up-without-one>Madonna On Being A Mother After Growing Up Without One</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/madonna-2011-vanity-fair-oscar-party.jpg><p>It's not the first time Madonna has talked about her mom, and she admits that she always misses her and wishes she could have been around to teach her things she had to learn on her own.
