Netizens flocked to Twitter to condemn the singer, accusing her of undermining other struggling female filmmakers who need more attention.&nbsp;Directors on Directors is an annual presentation in which prominent directors discuss the year’s major films as well as their directing experiences.</p><p>This year’s cast of directors includes pop singer Taylor Swift, who is being honored for directing her music video All Too Well, which was published in November. The series, which will air on December 12, will begin with a dialogue between Martin McDonagh and Taylor Swift.</p><p>Variety co-editor-in-chief Ramin Setoodeh stated:</p><p>“Since Taylor Swift’s short film ‘All Too Well’ aired in New York last winter, Variety has been impressed with her vision as a filmmaker. We are thrilled to have her join James Cameron, Ryan Coogler, Gina Prince-Bythewood, and the other year’s most adventurous and successful filmmakers.”</p><p>James Cameron (Avatar: The Way of the Water), Robert Rodriguez, Ryan Coogler (Black Panther: Wakanda Forever), Gina Prince-Bythewood (The Woman King), Chinonye Chukwu (Till), Tyler Perry (A Jazzman’s Blues), Sarah Polley (Women Talking), Francis Ford Coppola, Joe Kosinski (Top Gun: Maverick), and Rian Johnson are among the other filmmakers set to appear on the (Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery).</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Taylor-Swift-1.jpg alt="Taylor Swift" width=330 height=330 sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>However, the majority of individuals are unhappy with Swift’s presence on the list and have voiced their displeasure with Variety’s judgment. Many people have criticized Taylor on Twitter, claiming that she just filmed a brief music video and lacks the years of expertise that the other filmmakers on the program have.&nbsp;One individual claimed to admire Taylor Swift but thought the attempt was ‘crazy.’</p><h2>Netizens criticize Taylor Swift for supposedly abusing her ‘power’ by participating in Variety’s Directors on Directors event.</h2><p>Taylor received a lot of love and comments from fans and reviewers for her 15-minute music video for All Too Well, which included actresses Sadie Sink and Dylan O’Brien. Her directing abilities were praised once the short film was released. The singer also unveiled the concept at the Toronto International Film Festival in September.&nbsp;People on social media have assumed that Taylor is gunning for an Oscar after learning that she may be nominated in the short film category at the Academy Awards. As a result, she is participating in Directors on Directors to solidify her foundation as a filmmaker.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Taylor Swift directed a 10min MUSIC VIDEO and is being paired with actual directors who have devoted their entire lives to the craft.</p><p>What did Martin McDonagh did to Variety to be disrespected like that? <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZpTN4Vg6XQ</a></p><p>— Stefano (@AllysPimp_) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">December 8, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Martin McDonagh explaining what it was like directing two of the best actors working right now to Taylor Swift who directed… Dylan O Brien and Sadie Sink <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/AmlteLzjwT</a></p><p>— Hannah ❄️ (@rejectedhannah) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">December 8, 2022</a></p><p>Several people, including some Taylor Swift fans, are upset over her appearance on the program.&nbsp;Their main fear is that Taylor will deprive many other filmmakers who need this acclaim and exposure more than she does, as well as the chance to display their work on a prominent stage.&nbsp;Another user went on to compile a list of female filmmakers for whom this platform may have been a tremendous chance if Taylor’s music video hadn’t overshadowed their work.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Taylor-Swift-1.jpg alt="Taylor Swift" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Others are also doubting Taylor’s filmmaking background and directorial skills. They believe she is completely unsuited to speak with an experienced and Oscar-nominated filmmaker like Martin McDonagh.&nbsp;Despite this, some of her followers have remained loyal to her and praised her for being included in Directors on Directors.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lmah6pL7IraCcoaqasW6yzqtkqZmiqbaktc%2Baq6Kml2K2r3nVmqminaSuwG6wyKucnKyfp8Buu81mm6KqlZjBsL7SZq6irJhiuqK%2B06KlZqWTmbyvrcahZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./toru-iwatani-net-worth-189675.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Toru Iwatani Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sk8-the-infinity-ova-release-window-key-visuals-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>SK8 The Infinity OVA release window, key visuals, and more</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./chrishell-stause-works-up-a-sweat-in-steamy-bikini-workout-with-her-new-beau-jason-oppenheim.html>Chrishell Stause works up a sweat in steamy bikini workout with her new beau Jason Oppenheim</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gabrielle-reece-net-worth-146437.html>Gabrielle Reece Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-old-are-joe-goldberg-and-love-quinn-in-you.html>How Old Are Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn in You?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./celebrity-hairstyles.html>Kaley Cuoco's Beauty Transformation</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lana-rhoades-movie-actress-net-worth-237779.html>Lana Rhoades Net Worth 2024</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVibe.
